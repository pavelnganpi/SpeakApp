class=\"outline-text-2\" id=\"text-1\">\n\n\n<p>\nI started working on UglifyJS's successor, version 2.  It's almost a full\nrewrite (except for the parser which is heavily modified, everything else\nstarts from scratch).  I've detailed my reasons in the README, see the\nproject page.\n</p>\n<p>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2\">https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2</a>\n</p>\n<p>\nVersion 1 will continue to be maintained for fixing show-stopper bugs, but\nno new features should be expected.\n</p>\n<p>\nPlease help me focus on version 2 by <a href=\"http://pledgie.com/campaigns/18110\">making a donation</a>!\n</p>\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"outline-container-2\" class=\"outline-2\">\n<h2 id=\"sec-2\"><span class=\"section-number-2\">2</span> UglifyJS &mdash; a JavaScript parser/compressor/beautifier </h2>\n<div class=\"outline-text-2\" id=\"text-2\">\n\n\n<p>\nThis package implements a general-purpose JavaScript\nparser/compressor/beautifier toolkit.  It is developed on <a href=\"http://nodejs.org/\">NodeJS</a>, but it\nshould work on any JavaScript platform supporting the CommonJS module system\n(and if your platform of choice doesn't support CommonJS, you can easily\nimplement it, or discard the <code>exports.*</code> lines from UglifyJS sources).\n</p>\n<p>\nThe tokenizer/parser generates an abstract syntax tree from JS code.  You\ncan then traverse the AST to learn more about the code, or do various\nmanipulations on it.  This part is implemented in <a href=\"../lib/parse-js.js\">parse-js.js</a> and it's a\nport to JavaScript of the excellent <a href=\"http://marijn.haverbeke.nl/parse-js/\">parse-js</a> Common Lisp library from <a href=\"http://marijn.haverbeke.nl/\">Marijn Haverbeke</a>.\n</p>\n<p>\n( See <a href=\"http://github.com/mishoo/cl-uglify-js\">cl-uglify-js</a> if you're looking for the Common Lisp version of\nUglifyJS. )\n</p>\n<p>\nThe second part of this package, implemented in <a href=\"../lib/process.js\">process.js</a>, inspects and\nmanipulates the AST generated by the parser to provide the following:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ability to re-generate JavaScript code from the AST.  Optionally\n  indented&mdash;you can use this if you want to “beautify” a program that has\n  been compressed, so that you can inspect the source.  But you can also run\n  our code generator to print out an AST without any whitespace, so you\n  achieve compression as well.\n\n</li>\n<li>shorten variable names (usually to single characters).  Our mangler will\n  analyze the code and generate proper variable names, depending on scope\n  and usage, and is smart enough to deal with globals defined elsewhere, or\n  with <code>eval()</code> calls or <code>with{}</code> statements.  In short, if <code>eval()</code> or\n  <code>with{}</code> are used in some scope, then all variables in that scope and any\n  variables in the parent scopes will remain unmangled, and any references\n  to such variables remain unmangled as well.\n\n</li>\n<li>various small optimizations that may lead to faster code but certainly\n  lead to smaller code.  Where possible, we do the following:\n\n<ul>\n<li>foo[\"bar\"]  ==&gt;  foo.bar\n\n</li>\n<li>remove block brackets <code>{}</code>\n\n</li>\n<li>join consecutive var declarations:\n    var a = 10; var b = 20; ==&gt; var a=10,b=20;\n\n</li>\n<li>resolve simple constant expressions: 1 +2 * 3 ==&gt; 7.  We only do the\n    replacement if the result occupies less bytes; for example 1/3 would\n    translate to 0.333333333333, so in this case we don't replace it.\n\n</li>\n<li>consecutive statements in blocks are merged into a sequence; in many\n    cases, this leaves blocks with a single statement, so then we can remove\n    the block brackets.\n\n</li>\n<li>various optimizations for IF statements:\n\n<ul>\n<li>if (foo) bar(); else baz(); ==&gt; foo?bar():baz();\n</li>\n<li>if (!foo) bar(); else baz(); ==&gt; foo?baz():bar();\n</li>\n<li>if (foo) bar(); ==&gt; foo&amp;&amp;bar();\n</li>\n<li>if (!foo) bar(); ==&gt; foo||bar();\n</li>\n<li>if (foo) return bar(); else return baz(); ==&gt; return foo?bar():baz();\n</li>\n<li>if (foo) return bar(); else something(); ==&gt; {if(foo)return bar();something()}\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n</li>\n<li>remove some unreachable code and warn about it (code that follows a\n    <code>return</code>, <code>throw</code>, <code>break</code> or <code>continue</code> statement, except\n    function/variable declarations).\n\n</li>\n<li>act a limited version of a pre-processor (c.f. the pre-processor of\n    C/C++) to allow you to safely replace selected global symbols with\n    specified values.  When combined with the optimisations above this can\n    make UglifyJS operate slightly more like a compilation process, in\n    that when certain symbols are replaced by constant values, entire code\n    blocks may be optimised away as unreachable.\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"outline-container-2-1\" class=\"outline-3\">\n<h3 id=\"sec-2-1\"><span class=\"section-number-3\">2.1</span> <span class=\"target\">Unsafe transformations</span>  </h3>\n<div class=\"outline-text-3\" id=\"text-2-1\">\n\n\n<p>\nThe following transformations can in theory break code, although they're\nprobably safe in most practical cases.  To enable them you need to pass the\n<code>--unsafe</code> flag.\n</p>\n\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"outline-container-2-1-1\" class=\"outline-4\">\n<h4 id=\"sec-2-1-1\"><span class=\"section-number-4\">2.1.1</span> Calls involving the global Array constructor </h4>\n<div class=\"outline-text-4\" id=\"text-2-1-1\">\n\n\n<p>\nThe following transformations occur:\n</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"src src-js\"><span class=\"org-keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"org-type\">Array</span>(1, 2, 3, 4)  =&gt; [1,2,3,4]\nArray(a, b, c)         =&gt; [a,b,c]\n<span class=\"org-keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"org-type\">Array</span>(5)           =&gt; Array(5)\n<span class=\"org-keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"org-type\">Array</span>(a)           =&gt; Array(a)\n</pre>\n\n\n<p>\nThese are all safe if the Array name isn't redefined.  JavaScript does allow\none to globally redefine Array (and pretty much everything, in fact) but I\npersonally don't see why would anyone do that.\n</p>\n<p>\nUglifyJS does handle the case where Array is redefined locally, or even\nglobally but with a <code>function</code> or <code>var</code> declaration.  Therefore, in the\nfollowing cases UglifyJS <b>doesn't touch</b> calls or instantiations of Array:\n</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"src src-js\"><span class=\"org-comment-delimiter\">// </span><span class=\"org-comment\">case 1.  globally declared variable</span>\n  <span class=\"org-keyword\">var</span> <span class=\"org-variable-name\">Array</span>;\n  <span class=\"org-keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"org-type\">Array</span>(1, 2, 3);\n  Array(a, b);\n\n  <span class=\"org-comment-delimiter\">// </span><span class=\"org-comment\">or (can be declared later)</span>\n  <span class=\"org-keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"org-type\">Array</span>(1, 2, 3);\n  <span class=\"org-keyword\">var</span> <span class=\"org-variable-name\">Array</span>;\n\n  <span class=\"org-comment-delimiter\">// </span><span class=\"org-comment\">or (can be a function)</span>\n  <span class=\"org-keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"org-type\">Array</span>(1, 2, 3);\n  <span class=\"org-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"org-function-name\">Array</span>() { ... }\n\n<span class=\"org-comment-delimiter\">// </span><span class=\"org-comment\">case 2.  declared in a function</span>\n  (<span class=\"org-keyword\">function</span>(){\n    a = <span class=\"org-keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"org-type\">Array</span>(1, 2, 3);\n    b = Array(5, 6);\n    <span class=\"org-keyword\">var</span> <span class=\"org-variable-name\">Array</span>;\n  })();\n\n  <span class=\"org-comment-delimiter\">// </span><span class=\"org-comment\">or</span>\n  (<span class=\"org-keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"org-variable-name\">Array</span>){\n    <span class=\"org-keyword\">return</span> Array(5, 6, 7);\n  })();\n\n  <span class=\"org-comment-delimiter\">// </span><span class=\"org-comment\">or</span>\n  (<span class=\"org-keyword\">function</span>(){\n    <span class=\"org-keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"org-keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"org-type\">Array</span>(1, 2, 3, 4);\n    <span class=\"org-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"org-function-name\">Array</span>() { ... }\n  })();\n\n  <span class=\"org-comment-delimiter\">// </span><span class=\"org-comment\">etc.</span>\n</pre>\n\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"outline-container-2-1-2\" class=\"outline-4\">\n<h4 id=\"sec-2-1-2\"><span class=\"section-number-4\">2.1.2</span> <code>obj.toString()</code> ==&gt; <code>obj+“”</code> </h4>\n<div class=\"outline-text-4\" id=\"text-2-1-2\">\n\n\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"outline-container-2-2\" class=\"outline-3\">\n<h3 id=\"sec-2-2\"><span class=\"section-number-3\">2.2</span> Install (NPM) </h3>\n<div class=\"outline-text-3\" id=\"text-2-2\">\n\n\n<p>\nUglifyJS is now available through NPM &mdash; <code>npm install uglify-js</code> should do\nthe job.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"outline-container-2-3\" class=\"outline-3\">\n<h3 id=\"sec-2-3\"><span class=\"section-number-3\">2.3</span> Install latest code from GitHub </h3>\n<div class=\"outline-text-3\" id=\"text-2-3\">\n\n\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"src src-sh\"><span class=\"org-comment-delimiter\">## </span><span class=\"org-comment\">clone the repository</span>\nmkdir -p /where/you/wanna/put/it\n<span class=\"org-builtin\">cd</span> /where/you/wanna/put/it\ngit clone git://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS.git\n\n<span class=\"org-comment-delimiter\">## </span><span class=\"org-comment\">make the module available to Node</span>\nmkdir -p ~/.node_libraries/\n<span class=\"org-builtin\">cd</span> ~/.node_libraries/\nln -s /where/you/wanna/put/it/UglifyJS/uglify-js.js\n\n<span class=\"org-comment-delimiter\">## </span><span class=\"org-comment\">and if you want the CLI script too:</span>\nmkdir -p ~/bin\n<span class=\"org-builtin\">cd</span> ~/bin\nln -s /where/you/wanna/put/it/UglifyJS/bin/uglifyjs\n  <span class=\"org-comment-delimiter\"># </span><span class=\"org-comment\">(then add ~/bin to your $PATH if it's not there already)</span>\n</pre>\n\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"outline-container-2-4\" class=\"outline-3\">\n<h3 id=\"sec-2-4\"><span class=\"section-number-3\">2.4</span> Usage </h3>\n<div class=\"outline-text-3\" id=\"text-2-4\">\n\n\n<p>\nThere is a command-line tool that exposes the functionality of this library\nfor your shell-scripting needs:\n</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"src src-sh\">uglifyjs [ options... ] [ filename ]\n</pre>\n\n\n<p>\n<code>filename</code> should be the last argument and should name the file from which\nto read the JavaScript code.  If you don't specify it, it will read code\nfrom STDIN.\n</p>\n<p>\nSupported options:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>-b</code> or <code>--beautify</code> &mdash; output indented code; when passed, additional\n  options control the beautifier:\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>-i N</code> or <code>--indent N</code> &mdash; indentation level (number of spaces)\n\n</li>\n<li><code>-q</code> or <code>--quote-keys</code> &mdash; quote keys in literal objects (by default,\n    only keys that cannot be identifier names will be quotes).\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n</li>\n<li><code>-c</code> or <code>----consolidate-primitive-values</code> &mdash; consolidates null, Boolean,\n  and String values. Known as aliasing in the Closure Compiler. Worsens the\n  data compression ratio of gzip.\n\n</li>\n<li><code>--ascii</code> &mdash; pass this argument to encode non-ASCII characters as\n  <code>\\uXXXX</code> sequences.  By default UglifyJS won't bother to do it and will\n  output Unicode characters instead.  (the output is always encoded in UTF8,\n  but if you pass this option you'll only get ASCII).\n\n</li>\n<li><code>-nm</code> or <code>--no-mangle</code> &mdash; don't mangle names.\n\n</li>\n<li><code>-nmf</code> or <code>--no-mangle-functions</code> &ndash; in case you want to mangle variable\n  names, but not touch function names.\n\n</li>\n<li><code>-ns</code> or <code>--no-squeeze</code> &mdash; don't call <code>ast_squeeze()</code> (which does various\n  optimizations that result in smaller, less readable code).\n\n</li>\n<li><code>-mt</code> or <code>--mangle-toplevel</code> &mdash; mangle names in the toplevel scope too\n  (by default we don't do this).\n\n</li>\n<li><code>--no-seqs</code> &mdash; when <code>ast_squeeze()</code> is called (thus, unless you pass\n  <code>--no-squeeze</code>) it will reduce consecutive statements in blocks into a\n  sequence.  For example, \"a = 10; b = 20; foo();\" will be written as\n  \"a=10,b=20,foo();\".  In various occasions, this allows us to discard the\n  block brackets (since the block becomes a single statement).  This is ON\n  by default because it seems safe and saves a few hundred bytes on some\n  libs that I tested it on, but pass <code>--no-seqs</code> to disable it.\n\n</li>\n<li><code>--no-dead-code</code> &mdash; by default, UglifyJS will remove code that is\n  obviously unreachable (code that follows a <code>return</code>, <code>throw</code>, <code>break</code> or\n  <code>continue</code> statement and is not a function/variable declaration).  Pass\n  this option to disable this optimization.\n\n</li>\n<li><code>-nc</code> or <code>--no-copyright</code> &mdash; by default, <code>uglifyjs</code> will keep the initial\n  comment tokens in the generated code (assumed to be copyright information\n  etc.).  If you pass this it will discard it.\n\n</li>\n<li><code>-o filename</code> or <code>--output filename</code> &mdash; put the result in <code>filename</code>.  If\n  this isn't given, the result goes to standard output (or see next one).\n\n</li>\n<li><code>--overwrite</code> &mdash; if the code is read from a file (not from STDIN) and you\n  pass <code>--overwrite</code> then the output will be written in the same file.\n\n</li>\n<li><code>--ast</code> &mdash; pass this if you want to get the Abstract Syntax Tree instead\n  of JavaScript as output.  Useful for debugging or learning more about the\n  internals.\n\n</li>\n<li><code>-v</code> or <code>--verbose</code> &mdash; output some notes on STDERR (for now just how long\n  each operation takes).\n\n</li>\n<li><code>-d SYMBOL[=VALUE]</code> or <code>--define SYMBOL[=VALUE]</code> &mdash; will replace\n  all instances of the specified symbol where used as an identifier\n  (except where symbol has properly declared by a var declaration or\n  use as function parameter or similar) with the specified value. This\n  argument may be specified multiple times to define multiple\n  symbols - if no value is specified the symbol will be replaced with\n  the value <code>true</code>, or you can specify a numeric value (such as\n  <code>1024</code>), a quoted string value (such as =\"object\"= or\n  ='https://github.com'<code>), or the name of another symbol or keyword   (such as =null</code> or <code>document</code>).\n  This allows you, for example, to assign meaningful names to key\n  constant values but discard the symbolic names in the uglified\n  version for brevity/efficiency, or when used wth care, allows\n  UglifyJS to operate as a form of <b>conditional compilation</b>\n  whereby defining appropriate values may, by dint of the constant\n  folding and dead code removal features above, remove entire\n  superfluous code blocks (e.g. completely remove instrumentation or\n  trace code for production use).\n  Where string values are being defined, the handling of quotes are\n  likely to be subject to the specifics of your command shell\n  environment, so you may need to experiment with quoting styles\n  depending on your platform, or you may find the option\n  <code>--define-from-module</code> more suitable for use.\n\n</li>\n<li><code>-define-from-module SOMEMODULE</code> &mdash; will load the named module (as\n  per the NodeJS <code>require()</code> function) and iterate all the exported\n  properties of the module defining them as symbol names to be defined\n  (as if by the <code>--define</code> option) per the name of each property\n  (i.e. without the module name prefix) and given the value of the\n  property. This is a much easier way to handle and document groups of\n  symbols to be defined rather than a large number of <code>--define</code>\n  options.\n\n</li>\n<li><code>--unsafe</code> &mdash; enable other additional optimizations that are known to be\n  unsafe in some contrived situations, but could still be generally useful.\n  For now only these:\n\n<ul>\n<li>foo.toString()  ==&gt;  foo+\"\"\n</li>\n<li>new Array(x,&hellip;)  ==&gt; [x,&hellip;]\n</li>\n<li>new Array(x) ==&gt; Array(x)\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n</li>\n<li><code>--max-line-len</code> (default 32K characters) &mdash; add a newline after around\n  32K characters.  I've seen both FF and Chrome croak when all the code was\n  on a single line of around 670K.  Pass &ndash;max-line-len 0 to disable this\n  safety feature.\n\n</li>\n<li><code>--reserved-names</code> &mdash; some libraries rely on certain names to be used, as\n  pointed out in issue #92 and #81, so this option allow you to exclude such\n  names from the mangler.  For example, to keep names <code>require</code> and <code>$super</code>\n  intact you'd specify &ndash;reserved-names \"require,$super\".\n\n</li>\n<li><code>--inline-script</code> &ndash; when you want to include the output literally in an\n  HTML <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag you can use this option to prevent <code>&lt;/script</code> from\n  showing up in the output.\n\n</li>\n<li><code>--lift-vars</code> &ndash; when you pass this, UglifyJS will apply the following\n  transformations (see the notes in API, <code>ast_lift_variables</code>):\n\n<ul>\n<li>put all <code>var</code> declarations at the start of the scope\n</li>\n<li>make sure a variable is declared only once\n</li>\n<li>discard unused function arguments\n</li>\n<li>discard unused inner (named) functions\n</li>\n<li>finally, try to merge assignments into that one <code>var</code> declaration, if\n    possible.\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"outline-container-2-4-1\" class=\"outline-4\">\n<h4 id=\"sec-2-4-1\"><span class=\"section-number-4\">2.4.1</span> API </h4>\n<div class=\"outline-text-4\" id=\"text-2-4-1\">\n\n\n<p>\nTo use the library from JavaScript, you'd do the following (example for\nNodeJS):\n</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"src src-js\"><span class=\"org-keyword\">var</span> <span class=\"org-variable-name\">jsp</span> = require(<span class=\"org-string\">\"uglify-js\"</span>).parser;\n<span class=\"org-keyword\">var</span> <span class=\"org-variable-name\">pro</span> = require(<span class=\"org-string\">\"uglify-js\"</span>).uglify;\n\n<span class=\"org-keyword\">var</span> <span class=\"org-variable-name\">orig_code</span> = <span class=\"org-string\">\"... JS code here\"</span>;\n<span class=\"org-keyword\">var</span> <span class=\"org-variable-name\">ast</span> = jsp.parse(orig_code); <span class=\"org-comment-delimiter\">// </span><span class=\"org-comment\">parse code and get the initial AST</span>\nast = pro.ast_mangle(ast); <span class=\"org-comment-delimiter\">// </span><span class=\"org-comment\">get a new AST with mangled names</span>\nast = pro.ast_squeeze(ast); <span class=\"org-comment-delimiter\">// </span><span class=\"org-comment\">get an AST with compression optimizations</span>\n<span class=\"org-keyword\">var</span> <span class=\"org-variable-name\">final_code</span> = pro.gen_code(ast); <span class=\"org-comment-delimiter\">// </span><span class=\"org-comment\">compressed code here</span>\n</pre>\n\n\n<p>\nThe above performs the full compression that is possible right now.  As you\ncan see, there are a sequence of steps which you can apply.  For example if\nyou want compressed output but for some reason you don't want to mangle\nvariable names, you would simply skip the line that calls\n<code>pro.ast_mangle(ast)</code>.\n</p>\n<p>\nSome of these functions take optional arguments.  Here's a description:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>jsp.parse(code, strict_semicolons)</code> &ndash; parses JS code and returns an AST.\n  <code>strict_semicolons</code> is optional and defaults to <code>false</code>.  If you pass\n  <code>true</code> then the parser will throw an error when it expects a semicolon and\n  it doesn't find it.  For most JS code you don't want that, but it's useful\n  if you want to strictly sanitize your code.\n\n</li>\n<li><code>pro.ast_lift_variables(ast)</code> &ndash; merge and move <code>var</code> declarations to the\n  scop of the scope; discard unused function arguments or variables; discard\n  unused (named) inner functions.  It also tries to merge assignments\n  following the <code>var</code> declaration into it.\n\n<p>\n  If your code is very hand-optimized concerning <code>var</code> declarations, this\n  lifting variable declarations might actually increase size.  For me it\n  helps out.  On jQuery it adds 865 bytes (243 after gzip).  YMMV.  Also\n  note that (since it's not enabled by default) this operation isn't yet\n  heavily tested (please report if you find issues!).\n</p>\n<p>\n  Note that although it might increase the image size (on jQuery it gains\n  865 bytes, 243 after gzip) it's technically more correct: in certain\n  situations, dead code removal might drop variable declarations, which\n  would not happen if the variables are lifted in advance.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Here's an example of what it does:\n</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"src src-js\"><span class=\"org-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"org-function-name\">f</span>(<span class=\"org-variable-name\">a</span>, <span class=\"org-variable-name\">b</span>, <span class=\"org-variable-name\">c</span>, <span class=\"org-variable-name\">d</span>, <span class=\"org-variable-name\">e</span>) {\n    <span class=\"org-keyword\">var</span> <span class=\"org-variable-name\">q</span>;\n    <span class=\"org-keyword\">var</span> <span class=\"org-variable-name\">w</span>;\n    w = 10;\n    q = 20;\n    <span class=\"org-keyword\">for</span> (<span class=\"org-keyword\">var</span> <span class=\"org-variable-name\">i</span> = 1; i &lt; 10; ++i) {\n        <span class=\"org-keyword\">var</span> <span class=\"org-variable-name\">boo</span> = foo(a);\n    }\n    <span class=\"org-keyword\">for</span> (<span class=\"org-keyword\">var</span> <span class=\"org-variable-name\">i</span> = 0; i &lt; 1; ++i) {\n        <span class=\"org-keyword\">var</span> <span class=\"org-variable-name\">boo</span> = bar(c);\n    }\n    <span class=\"org-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"org-function-name\">foo</span>(){ ... }\n    <span class=\"org-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"org-function-name\">bar</span>(){ ... }\n    <span class=\"org-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"org-function-name\">baz</span>(){ ... }\n}\n\n<span class=\"org-comment-delimiter\">// </span><span class=\"org-comment\">transforms into ==&gt;</span>\n\n<span class=\"org-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"org-function-name\">f</span>(<span class=\"org-variable-name\">a</span>, <span class=\"org-variable-name\">b</span>, <span class=\"org-variable-name\">c</span>) {\n    <span class=\"org-keyword\">var</span> <span class=\"org-variable-name\">i</span>, <span class=\"org-variable-name\">boo</span>, <span class=\"org-variable-name\">w</span> = 10, <span class=\"org-variable-name\">q</span> = 20;\n    <span class=\"org-keyword\">for</span> (i = 1; i &lt; 10; ++i) {\n        boo = foo(a);\n    }\n    <span class=\"org-keyword\">for</span> (i = 0; i &lt; 1; ++i) {\n        boo = bar(c);\n    }\n    <span class=\"org-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"org-function-name\">foo</span>() { ... }\n    <span class=\"org-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"org-function-name\">bar</span>() { ... }\n}\n</pre>\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>pro.ast_mangle(ast, options)</code> &ndash; generates a new AST containing mangled\n  (compressed) variable and function names.

Similarly,\nwithin <code>CLAUSE2</code> both calls to <code>console.log()</code> will be removed\naltogether.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn this way you can mimic, to a limited degree, the functionality of\nthe C/C++ pre-processor to enable or completely remove blocks\ndepending on how certain symbols are defined - perhaps using UglifyJS\nto generate different versions of source aimed at different\nenvironments\n</p>\n<p>\nIt is recommmended (but not made mandatory) that symbols designed for\nthis purpose are given names consisting of <code>UPPER_CASE_LETTERS</code> to\ndistinguish them from other (normal) symbols and avoid the sort of\nclash that <code>CLAUSE3</code> above illustrates.\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"outline-container-2-5\" class=\"outline-3\">\n<h3 id=\"sec-2-5\"><span class=\"section-number-3\">2.5</span> Compression &ndash; how good is it? </h3>\n<div class=\"outline-text-3\" id=\"text-2-5\">\n\n\n<p>\nHere are updated statistics.

For\n[API and internals documentation see my website](http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/).\nThere's also an\n[in-browser online demo](http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/#demo) (for Firefox,\nChrome and probably Safari).\n\nInstall\n-------\n\nFrom NPM:\n\n    npm install uglify-js\n\nFrom Git:\n\n    git clone git://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2.git\n    cd UglifyJS2\n    npm link .\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n    uglifyjs [input files] [options]\n\nUglifyJS2 can take multiple input files.  It's recommended that you pass the\ninput files first, then pass the options.  UglifyJS will parse input files\nin sequence and apply any compression options.  The files are parsed in the\nsame global scope, that is, a reference from a file to some\nvariable/function declared in another file will be matched properly.\n\nIf you want to read from STDIN instead, pass a single dash instead of input\nfiles.\n\nThe available options are:\n\n    --source-map       Specify an output file where to generate source map.\n                                                                          [string]\n    --source-map-root  The path to the original source to be included in the\n                       source map.                                        [string]\n    --in-source-map    Input source map, useful if you're compressing JS that was\n                       generated from some other original code.\n    -p, --prefix       Skip prefix for original filenames that appear in source\n                       maps. For example -p 3 will drop 3 directories from file\n                       names and ensure they are relative paths.\n    -o, --output       Output file (default STDOUT).\n    -b, --beautify     Beautify output/specify output options.            [string]\n    -m, --mangle       Mangle names/pass mangler options.                 [string]\n    -r, --reserved     Reserved names to exclude from mangling.\n    -c, --compress     Enable compressor/pass compressor options. Pass options\n                       like -c hoist_vars=false,if_return=false. Use -c with no\n                       argument to use the default compression options.   [string]\n    -d, --define       Global definitions                                 [string]\n    --comments         Preserve copyright comments in the output. By default this\n                       works like Google Closure, keeping JSDoc-style comments\n                       that contain \"@license\" or \"@preserve\". You can optionally\n                       pass one of the following arguments to this flag:\n                       - \"all\" to keep all comments\n                       - a valid JS regexp (needs to start with a slash) to keep\n                       only comments that match.\n                       Note that currently not *all* comments can be kept when\n                       compression is on, because of dead code removal or\n                       cascading statements into sequences.               [string]\n    --stats            Display operations run time on STDERR.            [boolean]\n    --acorn            Use Acorn for parsing.                            [boolean]\n    --spidermonkey     Assume input fles are SpiderMonkey AST format (as JSON).\n                                                                         [boolean]\n    --self             Build itself (UglifyJS2) as a library (implies\n                       --wrap=UglifyJS --export-all)                     [boolean]\n    --wrap             Embed everything in a big function, making the “exports”\n                       and “global” variables available. You need to pass an\n                       argument to this option to specify the name that your\n                       module will take when included in, say, a browser.\n                                                                          [string]\n    --export-all       Only used when --wrap, this tells UglifyJS to add code to\n                       automatically export all globals.                 [boolean]\n    -v, --verbose      Verbose                                           [boolean]\n\nSpecify `--output` (`-o`) to declare the output file.  Otherwise the output\ngoes to STDOUT.\n\n## Source map options\n\nUglifyJS2 can generate a source map file, which is highly useful for\ndebugging your compressed JavaScript.  To get a source map, pass\n`--source-map output.js.map` (full path to the file where you want the\nsource map dumped).\n\nAdditionally you might need `--source-map-root` to pass the URL where the\noriginal files can be found.  In case you are passing full paths to input\nfiles to UglifyJS, you can use `--prefix` (`-p`) to specify the number of\ndirectories to drop from the path prefix when declaring files in the source\nmap.\n\nFor example:\n\n    uglifyjs /home/doe/work/foo/src/js/file1.js \\\n             /home/doe/work/foo/src/js/file2.js \\\n             -o foo.min.js \\\n             --source-map foo.min.js.map \\\n             --source-map-root http://foo.com/src \\\n             -p 5 -c -m\n\nThe above will compress and mangle `file1.js` and `file2.js`, will drop the\noutput in `foo.min.js` and the source map in `foo.min.js.map`.  The source\nmapping will refer to `http://foo.com/src/js/file1.js` and\n`http://foo.com/src/js/file2.js` (in fact it will list `http://foo.com/src`\nas the source map root, and the original files as `js/file1.js` and\n`js/file2.js`).\n\n### Composed source map\n\nWhen you're compressing JS code that was output by a compiler such as\nCoffeeScript, mapping to the JS code won't be too helpful.  Instead, you'd\nlike to map back to the original code (i.e. CoffeeScript).  UglifyJS has an\noption to take an input source map.  Assuming you have a mapping from\nCoffeeScript → compiled JS, UglifyJS can generate a map from CoffeeScript →\ncompressed JS by mapping every token in the compiled JS to its original\nlocation.\n\nTo use this feature you need to pass `--in-source-map\n/path/to/input/source.map`.  Normally the input source map should also point\nto the file containing the generated JS, so if that's correct you can omit\ninput files from the command line.\n\n## Mangler options\n\nTo enable the mangler you need to pass `--mangle` (`-m`).  Optionally you\ncan pass `-m sort` (we'll possibly have other flags in the future) in order\nto assign shorter names to most frequently used variables.  This saves a few\nhundred bytes on jQuery before gzip, but the output is _bigger_ after gzip\n(and seems to happen for other libraries I tried it on) therefore it's not\nenabled by default.\n\nWhen mangling is enabled but you want to prevent certain names from being\nmangled, you can declare those names with `--reserved` (`-r`) — pass a\ncomma-separated list of names.  For example:\n\n    uglifyjs ... -m -r '$,require,exports'\n\nto prevent the `require`, `exports` and `$` names from being changed.\n\n## Compressor options\n\nYou need to pass `--compress` (`-c`) to enable the compressor.  Optionally\nyou can pass a comma-separated list of options.  Options are in the form\n`foo=bar`, or just `foo` (the latter implies a boolean option that you want\nto set `true`; it's effectively a shortcut for `foo=true`).\n\nThe defaults should be tuned for maximum compression on most code.  Here are\nthe available options (all are `true` by default, except `hoist_vars`):\n\n- `sequences` -- join consecutive simple statements using the comma operator\n- `properties` -- rewrite property access using the dot notation, for\n  example `foo[\"bar\"] → foo.bar`\n- `dead-code` -- remove unreachable code\n- `drop-debugger` -- remove `debugger;` statements\n- `unsafe` -- apply \"unsafe\" transformations (discussion below)\n- `conditionals` -- apply optimizations for `if`-s and conditional\n  expressions\n- `comparisons` -- apply certain optimizations to binary nodes, for example:\n  `!(a <= b) → a > b` (only when `unsafe`), attempts to negate binary nodes,\n  e.g. `a = !b && !c && !d && !e → a=!(b||c||d||e)` etc.\n- `evaluate` -- attempt to evaluate constant expressions\n- `booleans` -- various optimizations for boolean context, for example `!!a\n  ? b : c → a ? b : c`\n- `loops` -- optimizations for `do`, `while` and `for` loops when we can\n  statically determine the condition\n- `unused` -- drop unreferenced functions and variables\n- `hoist-funs` -- hoist function declarations\n- `hoist-vars` -- hoist `var` declarations (this is `false` by default\n  because it seems to increase the size of the output in general)\n- `if-return` -- optimizations for if/return and if/continue\n- `join-vars` -- join consecutive `var` statements\n- `cascade` -- small optimization for sequences, transform `x, x` into `x`\n  and `x = something(), x` into `x = something()`\n- `warnings` -- display warnings when dropping unreachable code or unused\n  declarations etc.\n\n### Conditional compilation\n\nYou can use the `--define` (`-d`) switch in order to declare global\nvariables that UglifyJS will assume to be constants (unless defined in\nscope).  For example if you pass `--define DEBUG=false` then, coupled with\ndead code removal UglifyJS will discard the following from the output:\n\n    if (DEBUG) {\n        console.log(\"debug stuff\");\n    }\n\nUglifyJS will warn about the condition being always false and about dropping\nunreachable code; for now there is no option to turn off only this specific\nwarning, you can pass `warnings=false` to turn off *all* warnings.\n\nAnother way of doing that is to declare your globals as constants in a\nseparate file and include it into the build.  For example you can have a\n`build/defines.js` file with the following:\n\n    const DEBUG = false;\n    const PRODUCTION = true;\n    // etc.\n\nand build your code like this:\n\n    uglifyjs build/defines.js js/foo.js js/bar.js... -c\n\nUglifyJS will notice the constants and, since they cannot be altered, it\nwill evaluate references to them to the value itself and drop unreachable\ncode as usual.  The possible downside of this approach is that the build\nwill contain the `const` declarations.\n\n## Beautifier options\n\nThe code generator tries to output shortest code possible by default.  In\ncase you want beautified output, pass `--beautify` (`-b`).  Optionally you\ncan pass additional arguments that control the code output:\n\n- `beautify` (default `true`) -- whether to actually beautify the output.\n  Passing `-b` will set this to true, but you might need to pass `-b` even\n  when you want to generate minified code, in order to specify additional\n  arguments, so you can use `-b beautify=false` to override it.\n- `indent-level` (default 4)\n- `indent-start` (default 0) -- prefix all lines by that many spaces\n- `quote-keys` (default `false`) -- pass `true` to quote all keys in literal\n  objects\n- `space-colon` (default `true`) -- insert a space after the colon signs\n- `ascii-only` (default `false`) -- escape Unicode characters in strings and\n  regexps\n- `inline-script` (default `false`) -- escape the slash in occurrences of\n  `</script` in strings\n- `width` (default 80) -- only takes effect when beautification is on, this\n  specifies an (orientative) line width that the beautifier will try to\n  obey.  It refers to the width of the line text (excluding indentation).\n  It doesn't work very well currently, but it does make the code generated\n  by UglifyJS more readable.\n- `max-line-len` (default 32000) -- maximum line length (for uglified code)\n- `ie-proof` (default `true`) -- generate “IE-proof” code (for now this\n  means add brackets around the do/while in code like this: `if (foo) do\n  something(); while (bar); else ...`.\n- `bracketize` (default `false`) -- always insert brackets in `if`, `for`,\n  `do`, `while` or `with` statements, even if their body is a single\n  statement.\n- `semicolons` (default `true`) -- separate statements with semicolons.  If\n  you pass `false` then whenever possible we will use a newline instead of a\n  semicolon, leading to more readable output of uglified code (size before\n  gzip could be smaller; size after gzip insignificantly larger).\n\n### Keeping copyright notices or other comments\n\nYou can pass `--comments` to retain certain comments in the output.  By\ndefault it will keep JSDoc-style comments that contain \"@preserve\",\n\"@license\" or \"@cc_on\" (conditional compilation for IE).  You can pass\n`--comments all` to keep all the comments, or a valid JavaScript regexp to\nkeep only comments that match this regexp.  For example `--comments\n'/foo|bar/'` will keep only comments that contain \"foo\" or \"bar\".\n\nNote, however, that there might be situations where comments are lost.  For\nexample:\n\n    function f() {\n      /** @preserve Foo Bar */\n      function g() {\n        // this function is never called\n      }\n      return something();\n    }\n\nEven though it has \"@preserve\", the comment will be lost because the inner\nfunction `g` (which is the AST node to which the comment is attached to) is\ndiscarded by the compressor as not referenced.\n\nThe safest comments where to place copyright information (or other info that\nneeds to be kept in the output) are comments attached to toplevel nodes.\n\n## Support for the SpiderMonkey AST\n\nUglifyJS2 has its own abstract syntax tree format; for\n[practical reasons](http://lisperator.net/blog/uglifyjs-why-not-switching-to-spidermonkey-ast/)\nwe can't easily change to using the SpiderMonkey AST internally.  However,\nUglifyJS now has a converter which can import a SpiderMonkey AST.\n\nFor example [Acorn][acorn] is a super-fast parser that produces a\nSpiderMonkey AST.  It has a small CLI utility that parses one file and dumps\nthe AST in JSON on the standard output.  To use UglifyJS to mangle and\ncompress that:\n\n    acorn file.js | uglifyjs --spidermonkey -m -c\n\nThe `--spidermonkey` option tells UglifyJS that all input files are not\nJavaScript, but JS code described in SpiderMonkey AST in JSON.  Therefore we\ndon't use our own parser in this case, but just transform that AST into our\ninternal AST.\n\n### Use Acorn for parsing\n\nMore for fun, I added the `--acorn` option which will use Acorn to do all\nthe parsing.  If you pass this option, UglifyJS will `require(\"acorn\")`.\n\nAcorn is really fast (e.g. 250ms instead of 380ms on some 650K code), but\nconverting the SpiderMonkey tree that Acorn produces takes another 150ms so\nin total it's a bit more than just using UglifyJS's own parser.\n\nAPI Reference\n-------------\n\nAssuming installation via NPM, you can load UglifyJS in your application\nlike this:\n\n    var UglifyJS = require(\"uglify-js\");\n\nIt exports a lot of names, but I'll discuss here the basics that are needed\nfor parsing, mangling and compressing a piece of code.  The sequence is (1)\nparse, (2) compress, (3) mangle, (4) generate output code.\n\n### The simple way\n\nThere's a single toplevel function which combines all the steps.  If you\ndon't need additional customization, you might want to go with `minify`.\nExample:\n\n    // see \"fromString\" below if you need to pass code instead of file name\n    var result = UglifyJS.minify(\"/path/to/file.js\");\n    console.log(result.code); // minified output\n\nYou can also compress multiple files:\n\n    var result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ]);\n    console.log(result.code);\n\nTo generate a source map:\n\n    var result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ], {\n        outSourceMap: \"out.js.map\"\n    });\n    console.log(result.code); // minified output\n    console.log(result.map);\n\nNote that the source map is not saved in a file, it's just returned in\n`result.map`.  The value passed for `outSourceMap` is only used to set the\n`file` attribute in the source map (see [the spec][sm-spec]).\n\nYou can also specify sourceRoot property to be included in source map:\n\n    var result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ], {\n        outSourceMap: \"out.js.map\",\n        sourceRoot: \"http://example.com/src\"\n    });\n\n\nIf you're compressing compiled JavaScript and have a source map for it, you\ncan use the `inSourceMap` argument:\n\n    var result = UglifyJS.minify(\"compiled.js\", {\n        inSourceMap: \"compiled.js.map\",\n        outSourceMap: \"minified.js.map\"\n    });\n    // same as before, it returns `code` and `map`\n\nThe `inSourceMap` is only used if you also request `outSourceMap` (it makes\nno sense otherwise).\n\nOther options:\n\n- `warnings` (default `false`) — pass `true` to display compressor warnings.\n- `fromString` (default `false`) — if you pass `true` then you can pass\n  JavaScript source code, rather than file names.\n\nWe could add more options to `UglifyJS.minify` — if you need additional\nfunctionality please suggest!\n\n### The hard way\n\nFollowing there's more detailed API info, in case the `minify` function is\ntoo simple for your needs.\n\n#### The parser\n\n    var toplevel_ast = UglifyJS.parse(code, options);\n\n`options` is optional and if present it must be an object.  The following\nproperties are available:\n\n- `strict` — disable automatic semicolon insertion and support for trailing\n  comma in arrays and objects\n- `filename` — the name of the file where this code is coming from\n- `toplevel` — a `toplevel` node (as returned by a previous invocation of\n  `parse`)\n\nThe last two options are useful when you'd like to minify multiple files and\nget a single file as the output and a proper source map.  Our CLI tool does\nsomething like this:\n\n    var toplevel = null;\n    files.forEach(function(file){\n        var code = fs.readFileSync(file);\n        toplevel = UglifyJS.parse(code, {\n            filename: file,\n            toplevel: toplevel\n        });\n    });\n\nAfter this, we have in `toplevel` a big AST containing all our files, with\neach token having proper information about where it came from.\n\n#### Scope information\n\nUglifyJS contains a scope analyzer that you need to call manually before\ncompressing or mangling.  Basically it augments various nodes in the AST\nwith information about where is a name defined, how many times is a name\nreferenced, if it is a global or not, if a function is using `eval` or the\n`with` statement etc.  I will discuss this some place else, for now what's\nimportant to know is that you need to call the following before doing\nanything with the tree:\n\n    toplevel.figure_out_scope()\n\n#### Compression\n\nLike this:\n\n    var compressor = UglifyJS.Compressor(options);\n    var compressed_ast = toplevel.transform(compressor);\n\nThe `options` can be missing.  Available options are discussed above in\n“Compressor options”.  Defaults should lead to best compression in most\nscripts.\n\nThe compressor is destructive, so don't rely that `toplevel` remains the\noriginal tree.\n\n#### Mangling\n\nAfter compression it is a good idea to call again `figure_out_scope` (since\nthe compressor might drop unused variables / unreachable code and this might\nchange the number of identifiers or their position).  Optionally, you can\ncall a trick that helps after Gzip (counting character frequency in\nnon-mangleable words).  Example:\n\n    compressed_ast.figure_out_scope();\n    compressed_ast.compute_char_frequency();\n    compressed_ast.mangle_names();\n\n#### Generating output\n\nAST nodes have a `print` method that takes an output stream.  Essentially,\nto generate code you do this:\n\n    var stream = UglifyJS.OutputStream(options);\n    compressed_ast.print(stream);\n    var code = stream.toString(); // this is your minified code\n\nor, for a shortcut you can do:\n\n    var code = compressed_ast.print_to_string(options);\n\nAs usual, `options` is optional.  The output stream accepts a lot of otions,\nmost of them documented above in section “Beautifier options”.  The two\nwhich we care about here are `source_map` and `comments`.\n\n#### Keeping comments in the output\n\nIn order to keep certain comments in the output you need to pass the\n`comments` option.  Pass a RegExp or a function.  If you pass a RegExp, only\nthose comments whose body matches the regexp will be kept.  Note that body\nmeans without the initial `//` or `/*`.  If you pass a function, it will be\ncalled for every comment in the tree and will receive two arguments: the\nnode that the comment is attached to, and the comment token itself.\n\nThe comment token has these properties:\n\n- `type`: \"comment1\" for single-line comments or \"comment2\" for multi-line\n  comments\n- `value`: the comment body\n- `pos` and `endpos`: the start/end positions (zero-based indexes) in the\n  original code where this comment appears\n- `line` and `col`: the line and column where this comment appears in the\n  original code\n- `file` — the file name of the original file\n- `nlb` — true if there was a newline before this comment in the original\n  code, or if this comment contains a newline.\n\nYour function should return `true` to keep the comment, or a falsy value\notherwise.\n\n#### Generating a source mapping\n\nYou need to pass the `source_map` argument when calling `print`.  It needs\nto be a `SourceMap` object (which is a thin wrapper on top of the\n[source-map][source-map] library).\n\nExample:\n\n    var source_map = UglifyJS.SourceMap(source_map_options);\n    var stream = UglifyJS.OutputStream({\n        ...\n        source_map: source_map\n    });\n    compressed_ast.print(stream);\n\n    var code = stream.toString();\n    var map = source_map.toString(); // json output for your source map\n\nThe `source_map_options` (optional) can contain the following properties:\n\n- `file`: the name of the JavaScript output file that this mapping refers to\n- `root`: the `sourceRoot` property (see the [spec][sm-spec])\n- `orig`: the \"original source map\", handy when you compress generated JS\n  and want to map the minified output back to the original code where it\n  came from.  It can be simply a string in JSON, or a JSON object containing\n  the original source map.\n\n  [acorn]: https://github.com/marijnh/acorn\n  [source-map]: https://github.com/mozilla/source-map\n  [sm-spec]: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1RGAehQwRypUTovF1KRlpiOFze0b-_2gc6fAH0KY0k/edit\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","_id":"uglify-js@2.2.0","dist":{"shasum":"305c78992d03fe0ec3b0211f34615b533b7768eb","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/uglify-js/-/uglify-js-2.2.0.tgz"},"_npmVersion":"1.1.65","_npmUser":{"name":"mishoo","email":"mihai.bazon@gmail.com"},"directories":{}},"2.2.1":{"name":"uglify-js","description":"JavaScript parser, mangler/compressor and beautifier toolkit","homepage":"http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs","main":"tools/node.js","version":"2.2.1","engines":{"node":">=0.4.0"},"maintainers":[{"name":"caires","email":"cairesvs@gmail.com"},{"name":"mape","email":"mape@mape.me"},{"name":"mishoo","email":"mihai.bazon@gmail.com"}],"repositories":[{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2.git"}],"dependencies":{"source-map":"~0.1.7","optimist":"~0.3.5"},"bin":{"uglifyjs":"bin/uglifyjs"},"scripts":{"test":"node test/run-tests.js"},"readme":"UglifyJS 2\n==========\n\nUglifyJS is a JavaScript parser, minifier, compressor or beautifier toolkit.\n\nThis page documents the command line utility.

It's recommended that you pass the\ninput files first, then pass the options.  UglifyJS will parse input files\nin sequence and apply any compression options.  The files are parsed in the\nsame global scope, that is, a reference from a file to some\nvariable/function declared in another file will be matched properly.\n\nIf you want to read from STDIN instead, pass a single dash instead of input\nfiles.\n\nThe available options are:\n\n    --source-map       Specify an output file where to generate source map.\n                                                                          [string]\n    --source-map-root  The path to the original source to be included in the\n                       source map.                                        [string]\n    --in-source-map    Input source map, useful if you're compressing JS that was\n                       generated from some other original code.\n    -p, --prefix       Skip prefix for original filenames that appear in source\n                       maps. For example -p 3 will drop 3 directories from file\n                       names and ensure they are relative paths.\n    -o, --output       Output file (default STDOUT).\n    -b, --beautify     Beautify output/specify output options.

By default this\n                       works like Google Closure, keeping JSDoc-style comments\n                       that contain \"@license\" or \"@preserve\". You can optionally\n                       pass one of the following arguments to this flag:\n                       - \"all\" to keep all comments\n                       - a valid JS regexp (needs to start with a slash) to keep\n                       only comments that match.\n                       Note that currently not *all* comments can be kept when\n                       compression is on, because of dead code removal or\n                       cascading statements into sequences.

You need to pass an\n                       argument to this option to specify the name that your\n                       module will take when included in, say, a browser.\n                                                                          [string]\n    --export-all       Only used when --wrap, this tells UglifyJS to add code to\n                       automatically export all globals.                 [boolean]\n    -v, --verbose      Verbose                                           [boolean]\n\nSpecify `--output` (`-o`) to declare the output file.  Otherwise the output\ngoes to STDOUT.\n\n## Source map options\n\nUglifyJS2 can generate a source map file, which is highly useful for\ndebugging your compressed JavaScript.  To get a source map, pass\n`--source-map output.js.map` (full path to the file where you want the\nsource map dumped).\n\nAdditionally you might need `--source-map-root` to pass the URL where the\noriginal files can be found.  In case you are passing full paths to input\nfiles to UglifyJS, you can use `--prefix` (`-p`) to specify the number of\ndirectories to drop from the path prefix when declaring files in the source\nmap.\n\nFor example:\n\n    uglifyjs /home/doe/work/foo/src/js/file1.js \\\n             /home/doe/work/foo/src/js/file2.js \\\n             -o foo.min.js \\\n             --source-map foo.min.js.map \\\n             --source-map-root http://foo.com/src \\\n             -p 5 -c -m\n\nThe above will compress and mangle `file1.js` and `file2.js`, will drop the\noutput in `foo.min.js` and the source map in `foo.min.js.map`.  The source\nmapping will refer to `http://foo.com/src/js/file1.js` and\n`http://foo.com/src/js/file2.js` (in fact it will list `http://foo.com/src`\nas the source map root, and the original files as `js/file1.js` and\n`js/file2.js`).\n\n### Composed source map\n\nWhen you're compressing JS code that was output by a compiler such as\nCoffeeScript, mapping to the JS code won't be too helpful.  Instead, you'd\nlike to map back to the original code (i.e. CoffeeScript).  UglifyJS has an\noption to take an input source map.  Assuming you have a mapping from\nCoffeeScript → compiled JS, UglifyJS can generate a map from CoffeeScript →\ncompressed JS by mapping every token in the compiled JS to its original\nlocation.\n\nTo use this feature you need to pass `--in-source-map\n/path/to/input/source.map`.  Normally the input source map should also point\nto the file containing the generated JS, so if that's correct you can omit\ninput files from the command line.\n\n## Mangler options\n\nTo enable the mangler you need to pass `--mangle` (`-m`).  Optionally you\ncan pass `-m sort` (we'll possibly have other flags in the future) in order\nto assign shorter names to most frequently used variables.  This saves a few\nhundred bytes on jQuery before gzip, but the output is _bigger_ after gzip\n(and seems to happen for other libraries I tried it on) therefore it's not\nenabled by default.\n\nWhen mangling is enabled but you want to prevent certain names from being\nmangled, you can declare those names with `--reserved` (`-r`) — pass a\ncomma-separated list of names.  For example:\n\n    uglifyjs ... -m -r '$,require,exports'\n\nto prevent the `require`, `exports` and `$` names from being changed.\n\n## Compressor options\n\nYou need to pass `--compress` (`-c`) to enable the compressor.  Optionally\nyou can pass a comma-separated list of options.  Options are in the form\n`foo=bar`, or just `foo` (the latter implies a boolean option that you want\nto set `true`; it's effectively a shortcut for `foo=true`).\n\nThe defaults should be tuned for maximum compression on most code.  Here are\nthe available options (all are `true` by default, except `hoist_vars`):\n\n- `sequences` -- join consecutive simple statements using the comma operator\n- `properties` -- rewrite property access using the dot notation, for\n  example `foo[\"bar\"] → foo.bar`\n- `dead-code` -- remove unreachable code\n- `drop-debugger` -- remove `debugger;` statements\n- `unsafe` -- apply \"unsafe\" transformations (discussion below)\n- `conditionals` -- apply optimizations for `if`-s and conditional\n  expressions\n- `comparisons` -- apply certain optimizations to binary nodes, for example:\n  `!(a <= b) → a > b` (only when `unsafe`), attempts to negate binary nodes,\n  e.g. `a = !b && !c && !d && !e → a=!(b||c||d||e)` etc.\n- `evaluate` -- attempt to evaluate constant expressions\n- `booleans` -- various optimizations for boolean context, for example `!!a\n  ? b : c → a ? b : c`\n- `loops` -- optimizations for `do`, `while` and `for` loops when we can\n  statically determine the condition\n- `unused` -- drop unreferenced functions and variables\n- `hoist-funs` -- hoist function declarations\n- `hoist-vars` -- hoist `var` declarations (this is `false` by default\n  because it seems to increase the size of the output in general)\n- `if-return` -- optimizations for if/return and if/continue\n- `join-vars` -- join consecutive `var` statements\n- `cascade` -- small optimization for sequences, transform `x, x` into `x`\n  and `x = something(), x` into `x = something()`\n- `warnings` -- display warnings when dropping unreachable code or unused\n  declarations etc.\n\n### Conditional compilation\n\nYou can use the `--define` (`-d`) switch in order to declare global\nvariables that UglifyJS will assume to be constants (unless defined in\nscope).  For example if you pass `--define DEBUG=false` then, coupled with\ndead code removal UglifyJS will discard the following from the output:\n\n    if (DEBUG) {\n        console.log(\"debug stuff\");\n    }\n\nUglifyJS will warn about the condition being always false and about dropping\nunreachable code; for now there is no option to turn off only this specific\nwarning, you can pass `warnings=false` to turn off *all* warnings.\n\nAnother way of doing that is to declare your globals as constants in a\nseparate file and include it into the build.  For example you can have a\n`build/defines.js` file with the following:\n\n    const DEBUG = false;\n    const PRODUCTION = true;\n    // etc.\n\nand build your code like this:\n\n    uglifyjs build/defines.js js/foo.js js/bar.js... -c\n\nUglifyJS will notice the constants and, since they cannot be altered, it\nwill evaluate references to them to the value itself and drop unreachable\ncode as usual.  The possible downside of this approach is that the build\nwill contain the `const` declarations.\n\n## Beautifier options\n\nThe code generator tries to output shortest code possible by default.  In\ncase you want beautified output, pass `--beautify` (`-b`).  Optionally you\ncan pass additional arguments that control the code output:\n\n- `beautify` (default `true`) -- whether to actually beautify the output.\n  Passing `-b` will set this to true, but you might need to pass `-b` even\n  when you want to generate minified code, in order to specify additional\n  arguments, so you can use `-b beautify=false` to override it.\n- `indent-level` (default 4)\n- `indent-start` (default 0) -- prefix all lines by that many spaces\n- `quote-keys` (default `false`) -- pass `true` to quote all keys in literal\n  objects\n- `space-colon` (default `true`) -- insert a space after the colon signs\n- `ascii-only` (default `false`) -- escape Unicode characters in strings and\n  regexps\n- `inline-script` (default `false`) -- escape the slash in occurrences of\n  `</script` in strings\n- `width` (default 80) -- only takes effect when beautification is on, this\n  specifies an (orientative) line width that the beautifier will try to\n  obey.  It refers to the width of the line text (excluding indentation).\n  It doesn't work very well currently, but it does make the code generated\n  by UglifyJS more readable.\n- `max-line-len` (default 32000) -- maximum line length (for uglified code)\n- `ie-proof` (default `true`) -- generate “IE-proof” code (for now this\n  means add brackets around the do/while in code like this: `if (foo) do\n  something(); while (bar); else ...`.\n- `bracketize` (default `false`) -- always insert brackets in `if`, `for`,\n  `do`, `while` or `with` statements, even if their body is a single\n  statement.\n- `semicolons` (default `true`) -- separate statements with semicolons.  If\n  you pass `false` then whenever possible we will use a newline instead of a\n  semicolon, leading to more readable output of uglified code (size before\n  gzip could be smaller; size after gzip insignificantly larger).\n\n### Keeping copyright notices or other comments\n\nYou can pass `--comments` to retain certain comments in the output.  By\ndefault it will keep JSDoc-style comments that contain \"@preserve\",\n\"@license\" or \"@cc_on\" (conditional compilation for IE).  You can pass\n`--comments all` to keep all the comments, or a valid JavaScript regexp to\nkeep only comments that match this regexp.  For example `--comments\n'/foo|bar/'` will keep only comments that contain \"foo\" or \"bar\".\n\nNote, however, that there might be situations where comments are lost.  For\nexample:\n\n    function f() {\n      /** @preserve Foo Bar */\n      function g() {\n        // this function is never called\n      }\n      return something();\n    }\n\nEven though it has \"@preserve\", the comment will be lost because the inner\nfunction `g` (which is the AST node to which the comment is attached to) is\ndiscarded by the compressor as not referenced.\n\nThe safest comments where to place copyright information (or other info that\nneeds to be kept in the output) are comments attached to toplevel nodes.\n\n## Support for the SpiderMonkey AST\n\nUglifyJS2 has its own abstract syntax tree format; for\n[practical reasons](http://lisperator.net/blog/uglifyjs-why-not-switching-to-spidermonkey-ast/)\nwe can't easily change to using the SpiderMonkey AST internally.  However,\nUglifyJS now has a converter which can import a SpiderMonkey AST.\n\nFor example [Acorn][acorn] is a super-fast parser that produces a\nSpiderMonkey AST.  It has a small CLI utility that parses one file and dumps\nthe AST in JSON on the standard output.  To use UglifyJS to mangle and\ncompress that:\n\n    acorn file.js | uglifyjs --spidermonkey -m -c\n\nThe `--spidermonkey` option tells UglifyJS that all input files are not\nJavaScript, but JS code described in SpiderMonkey AST in JSON.  Therefore we\ndon't use our own parser in this case, but just transform that AST into our\ninternal AST.\n\n### Use Acorn for parsing\n\nMore for fun, I added the `--acorn` option which will use Acorn to do all\nthe parsing.  If you pass this option, UglifyJS will `require(\"acorn\")`.\n\nAcorn is really fast (e.g. 250ms instead of 380ms on some 650K code), but\nconverting the SpiderMonkey tree that Acorn produces takes another 150ms so\nin total it's a bit more than just using UglifyJS's own parser.\n\nAPI Reference\n-------------\n\nAssuming installation via NPM, you can load UglifyJS in your application\nlike this:\n\n    var UglifyJS = require(\"uglify-js\");\n\nIt exports a lot of names, but I'll discuss here the basics that are needed\nfor parsing, mangling and compressing a piece of code.  The sequence is (1)\nparse, (2) compress, (3) mangle, (4) generate output code.\n\n### The simple way\n\nThere's a single toplevel function which combines all the steps.  If you\ndon't need additional customization, you might want to go with `minify`.\nExample:\n\n    // see \"fromString\" below if you need to pass code instead of file name\n    var result = UglifyJS.minify(\"/path/to/file.js\");\n    console.log(result.code); // minified output\n\nYou can also compress multiple files:\n\n    var result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ]);\n    console.log(result.code);\n\nTo generate a source map:\n\n    var result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ], {\n        outSourceMap: \"out.js.map\"\n    });\n    console.log(result.code); // minified output\n    console.log(result.map);\n\nNote that the source map is not saved in a file, it's just returned in\n`result.map`.  The value passed for `outSourceMap` is only used to set the\n`file` attribute in the source map (see [the spec][sm-spec]).\n\nYou can also specify sourceRoot property to be included in source map:\n\n    var result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ], {\n        outSourceMap: \"out.js.map\",\n        sourceRoot: \"http://example.com/src\"\n    });\n\n\nIf you're compressing compiled JavaScript and have a source map for it, you\ncan use the `inSourceMap` argument:\n\n    var result = UglifyJS.minify(\"compiled.js\", {\n        inSourceMap: \"compiled.js.map\",\n        outSourceMap: \"minified.js.map\"\n    });\n    // same as before, it returns `code` and `map`\n\nThe `inSourceMap` is only used if you also request `outSourceMap` (it makes\nno sense otherwise).\n\nOther options:\n\n- `warnings` (default `false`) — pass `true` to display compressor warnings.\n- `fromString` (default `false`) — if you pass `true` then you can pass\n  JavaScript source code, rather than file names.\n\nWe could add more options to `UglifyJS.minify` — if you need additional\nfunctionality please suggest!\n\n### The hard way\n\nFollowing there's more detailed API info, in case the `minify` function is\ntoo simple for your needs.\n\n#### The parser\n\n    var toplevel_ast = UglifyJS.parse(code, options);\n\n`options` is optional and if present it must be an object.  The following\nproperties are available:\n\n- `strict` — disable automatic semicolon insertion and support for trailing\n  comma in arrays and objects\n- `filename` — the name of the file where this code is coming from\n- `toplevel` — a `toplevel` node (as returned by a previous invocation of\n  `parse`)\n\nThe last two options are useful when you'd like to minify multiple files and\nget a single file as the output and a proper source map.  Our CLI tool does\nsomething like this:\n\n    var toplevel = null;\n    files.forEach(function(file){\n        var code = fs.readFileSync(file);\n        toplevel = UglifyJS.parse(code, {\n            filename: file,\n            toplevel: toplevel\n        });\n    });\n\nAfter this, we have in `toplevel` a big AST containing all our files, with\neach token having proper information about where it came from.\n\n#### Scope information\n\nUglifyJS contains a scope analyzer that you need to call manually before\ncompressing or mangling.  Basically it augments various nodes in the AST\nwith information about where is a name defined, how many times is a name\nreferenced, if it is a global or not, if a function is using `eval` or the\n`with` statement etc.  I will discuss this some place else, for now what's\nimportant to know is that you need to call the following before doing\nanything with the tree:\n\n    toplevel.figure_out_scope()\n\n#### Compression\n\nLike this:\n\n    var compressor = UglifyJS.Compressor(options);\n    var compressed_ast = toplevel.transform(compressor);\n\nThe `options` can be missing.  Available options are discussed above in\n“Compressor options”.  Defaults should lead to best compression in most\nscripts.\n\nThe compressor is destructive, so don't rely that `toplevel` remains the\noriginal tree.\n\n#### Mangling\n\nAfter compression it is a good idea to call again `figure_out_scope` (since\nthe compressor might drop unused variables / unreachable code and this might\nchange the number of identifiers or their position).  Optionally, you can\ncall a trick that helps after Gzip (counting character frequency in\nnon-mangleable words).  Example:\n\n    compressed_ast.figure_out_scope();\n    compressed_ast.compute_char_frequency();\n    compressed_ast.mangle_names();\n\n#### Generating output\n\nAST nodes have a `print` method that takes an output stream.  Essentially,\nto generate code you do this:\n\n    var stream = UglifyJS.OutputStream(options);\n    compressed_ast.print(stream);\n    var code = stream.toString(); // this is your minified code\n\nor, for a shortcut you can do:\n\n    var code = compressed_ast.print_to_string(options);\n\nAs usual, `options` is optional.  The output stream accepts a lot of otions,\nmost of them documented above in section “Beautifier options”.  The two\nwhich we care about here are `source_map` and `comments`.\n\n#### Keeping comments in the output\n\nIn order to keep certain comments in the output you need to pass the\n`comments` option.  Pass a RegExp or a function.  If you pass a RegExp, only\nthose comments whose body matches the regexp will be kept.  Note that body\nmeans without the initial `//` or `/*`.  If you pass a function, it will be\ncalled for every comment in the tree and will receive two arguments: the\nnode that the comment is attached to, and the comment token itself.\n\nThe comment token has these properties:\n\n- `type`: \"comment1\" for single-line comments or \"comment2\" for multi-line\n  comments\n- `value`: the comment body\n- `pos` and `endpos`: the start/end positions (zero-based indexes) in the\n  original code where this comment appears\n- `line` and `col`: the line and column where this comment appears in the\n  original code\n- `file` — the file name of the original file\n- `nlb` — true if there was a newline before this comment in the original\n  code, or if this comment contains a newline.\n\nYour function should return `true` to keep the comment, or a falsy value\notherwise.\n\n#### Generating a source mapping\n\nYou need to pass the `source_map` argument when calling `print`.  It needs\nto be a `SourceMap` object (which is a thin wrapper on top of the\n[source-map][source-map] library).\n\nExample:\n\n    var source_map = UglifyJS.SourceMap(source_map_options);\n    var stream = UglifyJS.OutputStream({\n        ...\n        source_map: source_map\n    });\n    compressed_ast.print(stream);\n\n    var code = stream.toString();\n    var map = source_map.toString(); // json output for your source map\n\nThe `source_map_options` (optional) can contain the following properties:\n\n- `file`: the name of the JavaScript output file that this mapping refers to\n- `root`: the `sourceRoot` property (see the [spec][sm-spec])\n- `orig`: the \"original source map\", handy when you compress generated JS\n  and want to map the minified output back to the original code where it\n  came from.  It can be simply a string in JSON, or a JSON object containing\n  the original source map.\n\n  [acorn]: https://github.com/marijnh/acorn\n  [source-map]: https://github.com/mozilla/source-map\n  [sm-spec]: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1RGAehQwRypUTovF1KRlpiOFze0b-_2gc6fAH0KY0k/edit\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","_id":"uglify-js@2.2.1","dist":{"shasum":"c47e5f0ac40ea8cd951584d7cb08251085a02ea0","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/uglify-js/-/uglify-js-2.2.1.tgz"},"_npmVersion":"1.1.65","_npmUser":{"name":"mishoo","email":"mihai.bazon@gmail.com"},"directories":{}},"2.2.2":{"name":"uglify-js","description":"JavaScript parser, mangler/compressor and beautifier toolkit","homepage":"http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs","main":"tools/node.js","version":"2.2.2","engines":{"node":">=0.4.0"},"maintainers":[{"name":"caires","email":"cairesvs@gmail.com"},{"name":"mape","email":"mape@mape.me"},{"name":"mishoo","email":"mihai.bazon@gmail.com"}],"repositories":[{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2.git"}],"dependencies":{"source-map":"~0.1.7","optimist":"~0.3.5"},"bin":{"uglifyjs":"bin/uglifyjs"},"scripts":{"test":"node test/run-tests.js"},"readme":"UglifyJS 2\n==========\n\nUglifyJS is a JavaScript parser, minifier, compressor or beautifier toolkit.\n\nThis page documents the command line utility.

It's recommended that you pass the\ninput files first, then pass the options.  UglifyJS will parse input files\nin sequence and apply any compression options.  The files are parsed in the\nsame global scope, that is, a reference from a file to some\nvariable/function declared in another file will be matched properly.\n\nIf you want to read from STDIN instead, pass a single dash instead of input\nfiles.\n\nThe available options are:\n\n    --source-map       Specify an output file where to generate source map.\n                                                                          [string]\n    --source-map-root  The path to the original source to be included in the\n                       source map.

By default this\n                       works like Google Closure, keeping JSDoc-style comments\n                       that contain \"@license\" or \"@preserve\". You can optionally\n                       pass one of the following arguments to this flag:\n                       - \"all\" to keep all comments\n                       - a valid JS regexp (needs to start with a slash) to keep\n                       only comments that match.\n                       Note that currently not *all* comments can be kept when\n                       compression is on, because of dead code removal or\n                       cascading statements into sequences.

You need to pass an\n                       argument to this option to specify the name that your\n                       module will take when included in, say, a browser.\n                                                                          [string]\n    --export-all       Only used when --wrap, this tells UglifyJS to add code to\n                       automatically export all globals.                 [boolean]\n    -v, --verbose      Verbose                                           [boolean]\n\nSpecify `--output` (`-o`) to declare the output file.  Otherwise the output\ngoes to STDOUT.\n\n## Source map options\n\nUglifyJS2 can generate a source map file, which is highly useful for\ndebugging your compressed JavaScript.  To get a source map, pass\n`--source-map output.js.map` (full path to the file where you want the\nsource map dumped).\n\nAdditionally you might need `--source-map-root` to pass the URL where the\noriginal files can be found.  In case you are passing full paths to input\nfiles to UglifyJS, you can use `--prefix` (`-p`) to specify the number of\ndirectories to drop from the path prefix when declaring files in the source\nmap.\n\nFor example:\n\n    uglifyjs /home/doe/work/foo/src/js/file1.js \\\n             /home/doe/work/foo/src/js/file2.js \\\n             -o foo.min.js \\\n             --source-map foo.min.js.map \\\n             --source-map-root http://foo.com/src \\\n             -p 5 -c -m\n\nThe above will compress and mangle `file1.js` and `file2.js`, will drop the\noutput in `foo.min.js` and the source map in `foo.min.js.map`.  The source\nmapping will refer to `http://foo.com/src/js/file1.js` and\n`http://foo.com/src/js/file2.js` (in fact it will list `http://foo.com/src`\nas the source map root, and the original files as `js/file1.js` and\n`js/file2.js`).\n\n### Composed source map\n\nWhen you're compressing JS code that was output by a compiler such as\nCoffeeScript, mapping to the JS code won't be too helpful.  Instead, you'd\nlike to map back to the original code (i.e. CoffeeScript).  UglifyJS has an\noption to take an input source map.  Assuming you have a mapping from\nCoffeeScript → compiled JS, UglifyJS can generate a map from CoffeeScript →\ncompressed JS by mapping every token in the compiled JS to its original\nlocation.\n\nTo use this feature you need to pass `--in-source-map\n/path/to/input/source.map`.  Normally the input source map should also point\nto the file containing the generated JS, so if that's correct you can omit\ninput files from the command line.\n\n## Mangler options\n\nTo enable the mangler you need to pass `--mangle` (`-m`).  Optionally you\ncan pass `-m sort` (we'll possibly have other flags in the future) in order\nto assign shorter names to most frequently used variables.  This saves a few\nhundred bytes on jQuery before gzip, but the output is _bigger_ after gzip\n(and seems to happen for other libraries I tried it on) therefore it's not\nenabled by default.\n\nWhen mangling is enabled but you want to prevent certain names from being\nmangled, you can declare those names with `--reserved` (`-r`) — pass a\ncomma-separated list of names.  For example:\n\n    uglifyjs ... -m -r '$,require,exports'\n\nto prevent the `require`, `exports` and `$` names from being changed.\n\n## Compressor options\n\nYou need to pass `--compress` (`-c`) to enable the compressor.  Optionally\nyou can pass a comma-separated list of options.  Options are in the form\n`foo=bar`, or just `foo` (the latter implies a boolean option that you want\nto set `true`; it's effectively a shortcut for `foo=true`).\n\nThe defaults should be tuned for maximum compression on most code.  Here are\nthe available options (all are `true` by default, except `hoist_vars`):\n\n- `sequences` -- join consecutive simple statements using the comma operator\n- `properties` -- rewrite property access using the dot notation, for\n  example `foo[\"bar\"] → foo.bar`\n- `dead-code` -- remove unreachable code\n- `drop-debugger` -- remove `debugger;` statements\n- `unsafe` -- apply \"unsafe\" transformations (discussion below)\n- `conditionals` -- apply optimizations for `if`-s and conditional\n  expressions\n- `comparisons` -- apply certain optimizations to binary nodes, for example:\n  `!(a <= b) → a > b` (only when `unsafe`), attempts to negate binary nodes,\n  e.g. `a = !b && !c && !d && !e → a=!(b||c||d||e)` etc.\n- `evaluate` -- attempt to evaluate constant expressions\n- `booleans` -- various optimizations for boolean context, for example `!!a\n  ? b : c → a ? b : c`\n- `loops` -- optimizations for `do`, `while` and `for` loops when we can\n  statically determine the condition\n- `unused` -- drop unreferenced functions and variables\n- `hoist-funs` -- hoist function declarations\n- `hoist-vars` -- hoist `var` declarations (this is `false` by default\n  because it seems to increase the size of the output in general)\n- `if-return` -- optimizations for if/return and if/continue\n- `join-vars` -- join consecutive `var` statements\n- `cascade` -- small optimization for sequences, transform `x, x` into `x`\n  and `x = something(), x` into `x = something()`\n- `warnings` -- display warnings when dropping unreachable code or unused\n  declarations etc.\n\n### Conditional compilation\n\nYou can use the `--define` (`-d`) switch in order to declare global\nvariables that UglifyJS will assume to be constants (unless defined in\nscope).  For example if you pass `--define DEBUG=false` then, coupled with\ndead code removal UglifyJS will discard the following from the output:\n\n    if (DEBUG) {\n        console.log(\"debug stuff\");\n    }\n\nUglifyJS will warn about the condition being always false and about dropping\nunreachable code; for now there is no option to turn off only this specific\nwarning, you can pass `warnings=false` to turn off *all* warnings.\n\nAnother way of doing that is to declare your globals as constants in a\nseparate file and include it into the build.  For example you can have a\n`build/defines.js` file with the following:\n\n    const DEBUG = false;\n    const PRODUCTION = true;\n    // etc.\n\nand build your code like this:\n\n    uglifyjs build/defines.js js/foo.js js/bar.js... -c\n\nUglifyJS will notice the constants and, since they cannot be altered, it\nwill evaluate references to them to the value itself and drop unreachable\ncode as usual.  The possible downside of this approach is that the build\nwill contain the `const` declarations.\n\n## Beautifier options\n\nThe code generator tries to output shortest code possible by default.  In\ncase you want beautified output, pass `--beautify` (`-b`).  Optionally you\ncan pass additional arguments that control the code output:\n\n- `beautify` (default `true`) -- whether to actually beautify the output.\n  Passing `-b` will set this to true, but you might need to pass `-b` even\n  when you want to generate minified code, in order to specify additional\n  arguments, so you can use `-b beautify=false` to override it.\n- `indent-level` (default 4)\n- `indent-start` (default 0) -- prefix all lines by that many spaces\n- `quote-keys` (default `false`) -- pass `true` to quote all keys in literal\n  objects\n- `space-colon` (default `true`) -- insert a space after the colon signs\n- `ascii-only` (default `false`) -- escape Unicode characters in strings and\n  regexps\n- `inline-script` (default `false`) -- escape the slash in occurrences of\n  `</script` in strings\n- `width` (default 80) -- only takes effect when beautification is on, this\n  specifies an (orientative) line width that the beautifier will try to\n  obey.  It refers to the width of the line text (excluding indentation).\n  It doesn't work very well currently, but it does make the code generated\n  by UglifyJS more readable.\n- `max-line-len` (default 32000) -- maximum line length (for uglified code)\n- `ie-proof` (default `true`) -- generate “IE-proof” code (for now this\n  means add brackets around the do/while in code like this: `if (foo) do\n  something(); while (bar); else ...`.\n- `bracketize` (default `false`) -- always insert brackets in `if`, `for`,\n  `do`, `while` or `with` statements, even if their body is a single\n  statement.\n- `semicolons` (default `true`) -- separate statements with semicolons.  If\n  you pass `false` then whenever possible we will use a newline instead of a\n  semicolon, leading to more readable output of uglified code (size before\n  gzip could be smaller; size after gzip insignificantly larger).\n\n### Keeping copyright notices or other comments\n\nYou can pass `--comments` to retain certain comments in the output.  By\ndefault it will keep JSDoc-style comments that contain \"@preserve\",\n\"@license\" or \"@cc_on\" (conditional compilation for IE).  You can pass\n`--comments all` to keep all the comments, or a valid JavaScript regexp to\nkeep only comments that match this regexp.  For example `--comments\n'/foo|bar/'` will keep only comments that contain \"foo\" or \"bar\".\n\nNote, however, that there might be situations where comments are lost.  For\nexample:\n\n    function f() {\n      /** @preserve Foo Bar */\n      function g() {\n        // this function is never called\n      }\n      return something();\n    }\n\nEven though it has \"@preserve\", the comment will be lost because the inner\nfunction `g` (which is the AST node to which the comment is attached to) is\ndiscarded by the compressor as not referenced.\n\nThe safest comments where to place copyright information (or other info that\nneeds to be kept in the output) are comments attached to toplevel nodes.\n\n## Support for the SpiderMonkey AST\n\nUglifyJS2 has its own abstract syntax tree format; for\n[practical reasons](http://lisperator.net/blog/uglifyjs-why-not-switching-to-spidermonkey-ast/)\nwe can't easily change to using the SpiderMonkey AST internally.  However,\nUglifyJS now has a converter which can import a SpiderMonkey AST.\n\nFor example [Acorn][acorn] is a super-fast parser that produces a\nSpiderMonkey AST.  It has a small CLI utility that parses one file and dumps\nthe AST in JSON on the standard output.  To use UglifyJS to mangle and\ncompress that:\n\n    acorn file.js | uglifyjs --spidermonkey -m -c\n\nThe `--spidermonkey` option tells UglifyJS that all input files are not\nJavaScript, but JS code described in SpiderMonkey AST in JSON.  Therefore we\ndon't use our own parser in this case, but just transform that AST into our\ninternal AST.\n\n### Use Acorn for parsing\n\nMore for fun, I added the `--acorn` option which will use Acorn to do all\nthe parsing.  If you pass this option, UglifyJS will `require(\"acorn\")`.\n\nAcorn is really fast (e.g. 250ms instead of 380ms on some 650K code), but\nconverting the SpiderMonkey tree that Acorn produces takes another 150ms so\nin total it's a bit more than just using UglifyJS's own parser.\n\nAPI Reference\n-------------\n\nAssuming installation via NPM, you can load UglifyJS in your application\nlike this:\n\n    var UglifyJS = require(\"uglify-js\");\n\nIt exports a lot of names, but I'll discuss here the basics that are needed\nfor parsing, mangling and compressing a piece of code.  The sequence is (1)\nparse, (2) compress, (3) mangle, (4) generate output code.\n\n### The simple way\n\nThere's a single toplevel function which combines all the steps.  If you\ndon't need additional customization, you might want to go with `minify`.\nExample:\n\n    // see \"fromString\" below if you need to pass code instead of file name\n    var result = UglifyJS.minify(\"/path/to/file.js\");\n    console.log(result.code); // minified output\n\nYou can also compress multiple files:\n\n    var result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ]);\n    console.log(result.code);\n\nTo generate a source map:\n\n    var result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ], {\n        outSourceMap: \"out.js.map\"\n    });\n    console.log(result.code); // minified output\n    console.log(result.map);\n\nNote that the source map is not saved in a file, it's just returned in\n`result.map`.  The value passed for `outSourceMap` is only used to set the\n`file` attribute in the source map (see [the spec][sm-spec]).\n\nYou can also specify sourceRoot property to be included in source map:\n\n    var result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ], {\n        outSourceMap: \"out.js.map\",\n        sourceRoot: \"http://example.com/src\"\n    });\n\n\nIf you're compressing compiled JavaScript and have a source map for it, you\ncan use the `inSourceMap` argument:\n\n    var result = UglifyJS.minify(\"compiled.js\", {\n        inSourceMap: \"compiled.js.map\",\n        outSourceMap: \"minified.js.map\"\n    });\n    // same as before, it returns `code` and `map`\n\nThe `inSourceMap` is only used if you also request `outSourceMap` (it makes\nno sense otherwise).\n\nOther options:\n\n- `warnings` (default `false`) — pass `true` to display compressor warnings.\n- `fromString` (default `false`) — if you pass `true` then you can pass\n  JavaScript source code, rather than file names.\n\nWe could add more options to `UglifyJS.minify` — if you need additional\nfunctionality please suggest!\n\n### The hard way\n\nFollowing there's more detailed API info, in case the `minify` function is\ntoo simple for your needs.\n\n#### The parser\n\n    var toplevel_ast = UglifyJS.parse(code, options);\n\n`options` is optional and if present it must be an object.  The following\nproperties are available:\n\n- `strict` — disable automatic semicolon insertion and support for trailing\n  comma in arrays and objects\n- `filename` — the name of the file where this code is coming from\n- `toplevel` — a `toplevel` node (as returned by a previous invocation of\n  `parse`)\n\nThe last two options are useful when you'd like to minify multiple files and\nget a single file as the output and a proper source map.  Our CLI tool does\nsomething like this:\n\n    var toplevel = null;\n    files.forEach(function(file){\n        var code = fs.readFileSync(file);\n        toplevel = UglifyJS.parse(code, {\n            filename: file,\n            toplevel: toplevel\n        });\n    });\n\nAfter this, we have in `toplevel` a big AST containing all our files, with\neach token having proper information about where it came from.\n\n#### Scope information\n\nUglifyJS contains a scope analyzer that you need to call manually before\ncompressing or mangling.  Basically it augments various nodes in the AST\nwith information about where is a name defined, how many times is a name\nreferenced, if it is a global or not, if a function is using `eval` or the\n`with` statement etc.  I will discuss this some place else, for now what's\nimportant to know is that you need to call the following before doing\nanything with the tree:\n\n    toplevel.figure_out_scope()\n\n#### Compression\n\nLike this:\n\n    var compressor = UglifyJS.Compressor(options);\n    var compressed_ast = toplevel.transform(compressor);\n\nThe `options` can be missing.  Available options are discussed above in\n“Compressor options”.  Defaults should lead to best compression in most\nscripts.\n\nThe compressor is destructive, so don't rely that `toplevel` remains the\noriginal tree.\n\n#### Mangling\n\nAfter compression it is a good idea to call again `figure_out_scope` (since\nthe compressor might drop unused variables / unreachable code and this might\nchange the number of identifiers or their position).  Optionally, you can\ncall a trick that helps after Gzip (counting character frequency in\nnon-mangleable words).  Example:\n\n    compressed_ast.figure_out_scope();\n    compressed_ast.compute_char_frequency();\n    compressed_ast.mangle_names();\n\n#### Generating output\n\nAST nodes have a `print` method that takes an output stream.  Essentially,\nto generate code you do this:\n\n    var stream = UglifyJS.OutputStream(options);\n    compressed_ast.print(stream);\n    var code = stream.toString(); // this is your minified code\n\nor, for a shortcut you can do:\n\n    var code = compressed_ast.print_to_string(options);\n\nAs usual, `options` is optional.  The output stream accepts a lot of otions,\nmost of them documented above in section “Beautifier options”.  The two\nwhich we care about here are `source_map` and `comments`.\n\n#### Keeping comments in the output\n\nIn order to keep certain comments in the output you need to pass the\n`comments` option.  Pass a RegExp or a function.  If you pass a RegExp, only\nthose comments whose body matches the regexp will be kept.  Note that body\nmeans without the initial `//` or `/*`.  If you pass a function, it will be\ncalled for every comment in the tree and will receive two arguments: the\nnode that the comment is attached to, and the comment token itself.\n\nThe comment token has these properties:\n\n- `type`: \"comment1\" for single-line comments or \"comment2\" for multi-line\n  comments\n- `value`: the comment body\n- `pos` and `endpos`: the start/end positions (zero-based indexes) in the\n  original code where this comment appears\n- `line` and `col`: the line and column where this comment appears in the\n  original code\n- `file` — the file name of the original file\n- `nlb` — true if there was a newline before this comment in the original\n  code, or if this comment contains a newline.\n\nYour function should return `true` to keep the comment, or a falsy value\notherwise.\n\n#### Generating a source mapping\n\nYou need to pass the `source_map` argument when calling `print`.  It needs\nto be a `SourceMap` object (which is a thin wrapper on top of the\n[source-map][source-map] library).\n\nExample:\n\n    var source_map = UglifyJS.SourceMap(source_map_options);\n    var stream = UglifyJS.OutputStream({\n        ...\n        source_map: source_map\n    });\n    compressed_ast.print(stream);\n\n    var code = stream.toString();\n    var map = source_map.toString(); // json output for your source map\n\nThe `source_map_options` (optional) can contain the following properties:\n\n- `file`: the name of the JavaScript output file that this mapping refers to\n- `root`: the `sourceRoot` property (see the [spec][sm-spec])\n- `orig`: the \"original source map\", handy when you compress generated JS\n  and want to map the minified output back to the original code where it\n  came from.  It can be simply a string in JSON, or a JSON object containing\n  the original source map.\n\n  [acorn]: https://github.com/marijnh/acorn\n  [source-map]: https://github.com/mozilla/source-map\n  [sm-spec]: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1RGAehQwRypUTovF1KRlpiOFze0b-_2gc6fAH0KY0k/edit\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","_id":"uglify-js@2.2.2","dist":{"shasum":"3f8e186e8061850af4de524bcf867baf29609e16","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/uglify-js/-/uglify-js-2.2.2.tgz"},"_npmVersion":"1.1.66","_npmUser":{"name":"mishoo","email":"mihai.bazon@gmail.com"},"directories":{}},"2.2.3":{"name":"uglify-js","description":"JavaScript parser, mangler/compressor and beautifier toolkit","homepage":"http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs","main":"tools/node.js","version":"2.2.3","engines":{"node":">=0.4.0"},"maintainers":[{"name":"caires","email":"cairesvs@gmail.com"},{"name":"mape","email":"mape@mape.me"},{"name":"mishoo","email":"mihai.bazon@gmail.com"}],"repositories":[{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2.git"}],"dependencies":{"source-map":"~0.1.7","optimist":"~0.3.5"},"bin":{"uglifyjs":"bin/uglifyjs"},"scripts":{"test":"node test/run-tests.js"},"readme":"UglifyJS 2\n==========\n\nUglifyJS is a JavaScript parser, minifier, compressor or beautifier toolkit.\n\nThis page documents the command line utility.

It's recommended that you pass the\ninput files first, then pass the options.  UglifyJS will parse input files\nin sequence and apply any compression options.  The files are parsed in the\nsame global scope, that is, a reference from a file to some\nvariable/function declared in another file will be matched properly.\n\nIf you want to read from STDIN instead, pass a single dash instead of input\nfiles.\n\nThe available options are:\n\n    --source-map       Specify an output file where to generate source map.\n                                                                          [string]\n    --source-map-root  The path to the original source to be included in the\n                       source map.

By default this\n                       works like Google Closure, keeping JSDoc-style comments\n                       that contain \"@license\" or \"@preserve\". You can optionally\n                       pass one of the following arguments to this flag:\n                       - \"all\" to keep all comments\n                       - a valid JS regexp (needs to start with a slash) to keep\n                       only comments that match.\n                       Note that currently not *all* comments can be kept when\n                       compression is on, because of dead code removal or\n                       cascading statements into sequences.

You need to pass an\n                       argument to this option to specify the name that your\n                       module will take when included in, say, a browser.\n                                                                          [string]\n    --export-all       Only used when --wrap, this tells UglifyJS to add code to\n                       automatically export all globals.                 [boolean]\n    -v, --verbose      Verbose                                           [boolean]\n    -V, --version      Print version number and exits.                   [boolean]\n\nSpecify `--output` (`-o`) to declare the output file.  Otherwise the output\ngoes to STDOUT.\n\n## Source map options\n\nUglifyJS2 can generate a source map file, which is highly useful for\ndebugging your compressed JavaScript.  To get a source map, pass\n`--source-map output.js.map` (full path to the file where you want the\nsource map dumped).\n\nAdditionally you might need `--source-map-root` to pass the URL where the\noriginal files can be found.  In case you are passing full paths to input\nfiles to UglifyJS, you can use `--prefix` (`-p`) to specify the number of\ndirectories to drop from the path prefix when declaring files in the source\nmap.\n\nFor example:\n\n    uglifyjs /home/doe/work/foo/src/js/file1.js \\\n             /home/doe/work/foo/src/js/file2.js \\\n             -o foo.min.js \\\n             --source-map foo.min.js.map \\\n             --source-map-root http://foo.com/src \\\n             -p 5 -c -m\n\nThe above will compress and mangle `file1.js` and `file2.js`, will drop the\noutput in `foo.min.js` and the source map in `foo.min.js.map`.  The source\nmapping will refer to `http://foo.com/src/js/file1.js` and\n`http://foo.com/src/js/file2.js` (in fact it will list `http://foo.com/src`\nas the source map root, and the original files as `js/file1.js` and\n`js/file2.js`).\n\n### Composed source map\n\nWhen you're compressing JS code that was output by a compiler such as\nCoffeeScript, mapping to the JS code won't be too helpful.  Instead, you'd\nlike to map back to the original code (i.e. CoffeeScript).  UglifyJS has an\noption to take an input source map.  Assuming you have a mapping from\nCoffeeScript → compiled JS, UglifyJS can generate a map from CoffeeScript →\ncompressed JS by mapping every token in the compiled JS to its original\nlocation.\n\nTo use this feature you need to pass `--in-source-map\n/path/to/input/source.map`.  Normally the input source map should also point\nto the file containing the generated JS, so if that's correct you can omit\ninput files from the command line.\n\n## Mangler options\n\nTo enable the mangler you need to pass `--mangle` (`-m`).  Optionally you\ncan pass `-m sort=true` (we'll possibly have other flags in the future) in order\nto assign shorter names to most frequently used variables.  This saves a few\nhundred bytes on jQuery before gzip, but the output is _bigger_ after gzip\n(and seems to happen for other libraries I tried it on) therefore it's not\nenabled by default.\n\nWhen mangling is enabled but you want to prevent certain names from being\nmangled, you can declare those names with `--reserved` (`-r`) — pass a\ncomma-separated list of names.  For example:\n\n    uglifyjs ... -m -r '$,require,exports'\n\nto prevent the `require`, `exports` and `$` names from being changed.\n\n## Compressor options\n\nYou need to pass `--compress` (`-c`) to enable the compressor.  Optionally\nyou can pass a comma-separated list of options.  Options are in the form\n`foo=bar`, or just `foo` (the latter implies a boolean option that you want\nto set `true`; it's effectively a shortcut for `foo=true`).\n\nThe defaults should be tuned for maximum compression on most code.  Here are\nthe available options (all are `true` by default, except `hoist_vars`):\n\n- `sequences` -- join consecutive simple statements using the comma operator\n- `properties` -- rewrite property access using the dot notation, for\n  example `foo[\"bar\"] → foo.bar`\n- `dead-code` -- remove unreachable code\n- `drop-debugger` -- remove `debugger;` statements\n- `unsafe` -- apply \"unsafe\" transformations (discussion below)\n- `conditionals` -- apply optimizations for `if`-s and conditional\n  expressions\n- `comparisons` -- apply certain optimizations to binary nodes, for example:\n  `!(a <= b) → a > b` (only when `unsafe`), attempts to negate binary nodes,\n  e.g. `a = !b && !c && !d && !e → a=!(b||c||d||e)` etc.\n- `evaluate` -- attempt to evaluate constant expressions\n- `booleans` -- various optimizations for boolean context, for example `!!a\n  ? b : c → a ? b : c`\n- `loops` -- optimizations for `do`, `while` and `for` loops when we can\n  statically determine the condition\n- `unused` -- drop unreferenced functions and variables\n- `hoist-funs` -- hoist function declarations\n- `hoist-vars` -- hoist `var` declarations (this is `false` by default\n  because it seems to increase the size of the output in general)\n- `if-return` -- optimizations for if/return and if/continue\n- `join-vars` -- join consecutive `var` statements\n- `cascade` -- small optimization for sequences, transform `x, x` into `x`\n  and `x = something(), x` into `x = something()`\n- `warnings` -- display warnings when dropping unreachable code or unused\n  declarations etc.\n\n### Conditional compilation\n\nYou can use the `--define` (`-d`) switch in order to declare global\nvariables that UglifyJS will assume to be constants (unless defined in\nscope).  For example if you pass `--define DEBUG=false` then, coupled with\ndead code removal UglifyJS will discard the following from the output:\n\n    if (DEBUG) {\n        console.log(\"debug stuff\");\n    }\n\nUglifyJS will warn about the condition being always false and about dropping\nunreachable code; for now there is no option to turn off only this specific\nwarning, you can pass `warnings=false` to turn off *all* warnings.\n\nAnother way of doing that is to declare your globals as constants in a\nseparate file and include it into the build.  For example you can have a\n`build/defines.js` file with the following:\n\n    const DEBUG = false;\n    const PRODUCTION = true;\n    // etc.\n\nand build your code like this:\n\n    uglifyjs build/defines.js js/foo.js js/bar.js... -c\n\nUglifyJS will notice the constants and, since they cannot be altered, it\nwill evaluate references to them to the value itself and drop unreachable\ncode as usual.  The possible downside of this approach is that the build\nwill contain the `const` declarations.\n\n<a name=\"codegen-options\"></a>\n## Beautifier options\n\nThe code generator tries to output shortest code possible by default.  In\ncase you want beautified output, pass `--beautify` (`-b`).  Optionally you\ncan pass additional arguments that control the code output:\n\n- `beautify` (default `true`) -- whether to actually beautify the output.\n  Passing `-b` will set this to true, but you might need to pass `-b` even\n  when you want to generate minified code, in order to specify additional\n  arguments, so you can use `-b beautify=false` to override it.\n- `indent-level` (default 4)\n- `indent-start` (default 0) -- prefix all lines by that many spaces\n- `quote-keys` (default `false`) -- pass `true` to quote all keys in literal\n  objects\n- `space-colon` (default `true`) -- insert a space after the colon signs\n- `ascii-only` (default `false`) -- escape Unicode characters in strings and\n  regexps\n- `inline-script` (default `false`) -- escape the slash in occurrences of\n  `</script` in strings\n- `width` (default 80) -- only takes effect when beautification is on, this\n  specifies an (orientative) line width that the beautifier will try to\n  obey.  It refers to the width of the line text (excluding indentation).\n  It doesn't work very well currently, but it does make the code generated\n  by UglifyJS more readable.\n- `max-line-len` (default 32000) -- maximum line length (for uglified code)\n- `ie-proof` (default `true`) -- generate “IE-proof” code (for now this\n  means add brackets around the do/while in code like this: `if (foo) do\n  something(); while (bar); else ...`.\n- `bracketize` (default `false`) -- always insert brackets in `if`, `for`,\n  `do`, `while` or `with` statements, even if their body is a single\n  statement.\n- `semicolons` (default `true`) -- separate statements with semicolons.  If\n  you pass `false` then whenever possible we will use a newline instead of a\n  semicolon, leading to more readable output of uglified code (size before\n  gzip could be smaller; size after gzip insignificantly larger).\n\n### Keeping copyright notices or other comments\n\nYou can pass `--comments` to retain certain comments in the output.  By\ndefault it will keep JSDoc-style comments that contain \"@preserve\",\n\"@license\" or \"@cc_on\" (conditional compilation for IE).  You can pass\n`--comments all` to keep all the comments, or a valid JavaScript regexp to\nkeep only comments that match this regexp.  For example `--comments\n'/foo|bar/'` will keep only comments that contain \"foo\" or \"bar\".\n\nNote, however, that there might be situations where comments are lost.  For\nexample:\n\n    function f() {\n      /** @preserve Foo Bar */\n      function g() {\n        // this function is never called\n      }\n      return something();\n    }\n\nEven though it has \"@preserve\", the comment will be lost because the inner\nfunction `g` (which is the AST node to which the comment is attached to) is\ndiscarded by the compressor as not referenced.\n\nThe safest comments where to place copyright information (or other info that\nneeds to be kept in the output) are comments attached to toplevel nodes.\n\n## Support for the SpiderMonkey AST\n\nUglifyJS2 has its own abstract syntax tree format; for\n[practical reasons](http://lisperator.net/blog/uglifyjs-why-not-switching-to-spidermonkey-ast/)\nwe can't easily change to using the SpiderMonkey AST internally.  However,\nUglifyJS now has a converter which can import a SpiderMonkey AST.\n\nFor example [Acorn][acorn] is a super-fast parser that produces a\nSpiderMonkey AST.  It has a small CLI utility that parses one file and dumps\nthe AST in JSON on the standard output.  To use UglifyJS to mangle and\ncompress that:\n\n    acorn file.js | uglifyjs --spidermonkey -m -c\n\nThe `--spidermonkey` option tells UglifyJS that all input files are not\nJavaScript, but JS code described in SpiderMonkey AST in JSON.  Therefore we\ndon't use our own parser in this case, but just transform that AST into our\ninternal AST.\n\n### Use Acorn for parsing\n\nMore for fun, I added the `--acorn` option which will use Acorn to do all\nthe parsing.  If you pass this option, UglifyJS will `require(\"acorn\")`.\n\nAcorn is really fast (e.g. 250ms instead of 380ms on some 650K code), but\nconverting the SpiderMonkey tree that Acorn produces takes another 150ms so\nin total it's a bit more than just using UglifyJS's own parser.\n\nAPI Reference\n-------------\n\nAssuming installation via NPM, you can load UglifyJS in your application\nlike this:\n\n    var UglifyJS = require(\"uglify-js\");\n\nIt exports a lot of names, but I'll discuss here the basics that are needed\nfor parsing, mangling and compressing a piece of code.  The sequence is (1)\nparse, (2) compress, (3) mangle, (4) generate output code.\n\n### The simple way\n\nThere's a single toplevel function which combines all the steps.  If you\ndon't need additional customization, you might want to go with `minify`.\nExample:\n\n    // see \"fromString\" below if you need to pass code instead of file name\n    var result = UglifyJS.minify(\"/path/to/file.js\");\n    console.log(result.code); // minified output\n\nYou can also compress multiple files:\n\n    var result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ]);\n    console.log(result.code);\n\nTo generate a source map:\n\n    var result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ], {\n        outSourceMap: \"out.js.map\"\n    });\n    console.log(result.code); // minified output\n    console.log(result.map);\n\nNote that the source map is not saved in a file, it's just returned in\n`result.map`.  The value passed for `outSourceMap` is only used to set the\n`file` attribute in the source map (see [the spec][sm-spec]).\n\nYou can also specify sourceRoot property to be included in source map:\n\n    var result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ], {\n        outSourceMap: \"out.js.map\",\n        sourceRoot: \"http://example.com/src\"\n    });\n\n\nIf you're compressing compiled JavaScript and have a source map for it, you\ncan use the `inSourceMap` argument:\n\n    var result = UglifyJS.minify(\"compiled.js\", {\n        inSourceMap: \"compiled.js.map\",\n        outSourceMap: \"minified.js.map\"\n    });\n    // same as before, it returns `code` and `map`\n\nThe `inSourceMap` is only used if you also request `outSourceMap` (it makes\nno sense otherwise).\n\nOther options:\n\n- `warnings` (default `false`) — pass `true` to display compressor warnings.\n\n- `fromString` (default `false`) — if you pass `true` then you can pass\n  JavaScript source code, rather than file names.\n\n- `mangle` — pass `false` to skip mangling names.\n\n- `output` (default `null`) — pass an object if you wish to specify\n  additional [output options][codegen].  The defaults are optimized\n  for best compression.\n\n- `compress` (default `{}`) — pass `false` to skip compressing entirely.\n  Pass an object to specify custom [compressor options][compressor].\n\nWe could add more options to `UglifyJS.minify` — if you need additional\nfunctionality please suggest!\n\n### The hard way\n\nFollowing there's more detailed API info, in case the `minify` function is\ntoo simple for your needs.\n\n#### The parser\n\n    var toplevel_ast = UglifyJS.parse(code, options);\n\n`options` is optional and if present it must be an object.  The following\nproperties are available:\n\n- `strict` — disable automatic semicolon insertion and support for trailing\n  comma in arrays and objects\n- `filename` — the name of the file where this code is coming from\n- `toplevel` — a `toplevel` node (as returned by a previous invocation of\n  `parse`)\n\nThe last two options are useful when you'd like to minify multiple files and\nget a single file as the output and a proper source map.  Our CLI tool does\nsomething like this:\n\n    var toplevel = null;\n    files.forEach(function(file){\n        var code = fs.readFileSync(file);\n        toplevel = UglifyJS.parse(code, {\n            filename: file,\n            toplevel: toplevel\n        });\n    });\n\nAfter this, we have in `toplevel` a big AST containing all our files, with\neach token having proper information about where it came from.\n\n#### Scope information\n\nUglifyJS contains a scope analyzer that you need to call manually before\ncompressing or mangling.  Basically it augments various nodes in the AST\nwith information about where is a name defined, how many times is a name\nreferenced, if it is a global or not, if a function is using `eval` or the\n`with` statement etc.  I will discuss this some place else, for now what's\nimportant to know is that you need to call the following before doing\nanything with the tree:\n\n    toplevel.figure_out_scope()\n\n#### Compression\n\nLike this:\n\n    var compressor = UglifyJS.Compressor(options);\n    var compressed_ast = toplevel.transform(compressor);\n\nThe `options` can be missing.  Available options are discussed above in\n“Compressor options”.  Defaults should lead to best compression in most\nscripts.\n\nThe compressor is destructive, so don't rely that `toplevel` remains the\noriginal tree.\n\n#### Mangling\n\nAfter compression it is a good idea to call again `figure_out_scope` (since\nthe compressor might drop unused variables / unreachable code and this might\nchange the number of identifiers or their position).  Optionally, you can\ncall a trick that helps after Gzip (counting character frequency in\nnon-mangleable words).  Example:\n\n    compressed_ast.figure_out_scope();\n    compressed_ast.compute_char_frequency();\n    compressed_ast.mangle_names();\n\n#### Generating output\n\nAST nodes have a `print` method that takes an output stream.  Essentially,\nto generate code you do this:\n\n    var stream = UglifyJS.OutputStream(options);\n    compressed_ast.print(stream);\n    var code = stream.toString(); // this is your minified code\n\nor, for a shortcut you can do:\n\n    var code = compressed_ast.print_to_string(options);\n\nAs usual, `options` is optional.  The output stream accepts a lot of otions,\nmost of them documented above in section “Beautifier options”.  The two\nwhich we care about here are `source_map` and `comments`.\n\n#### Keeping comments in the output\n\nIn order to keep certain comments in the output you need to pass the\n`comments` option.  Pass a RegExp or a function.  If you pass a RegExp, only\nthose comments whose body matches the regexp will be kept.  Note that body\nmeans without the initial `//` or `/*`.  If you pass a function, it will be\ncalled for every comment in the tree and will receive two arguments: the\nnode that the comment is attached to, and the comment token itself.\n\nThe comment token has these properties:\n\n- `type`: \"comment1\" for single-line comments or \"comment2\" for multi-line\n  comments\n- `value`: the comment body\n- `pos` and `endpos`: the start/end positions (zero-based indexes) in the\n  original code where this comment appears\n- `line` and `col`: the line and column where this comment appears in the\n  original code\n- `file` — the file name of the original file\n- `nlb` — true if there was a newline before this comment in the original\n  code, or if this comment contains a newline.\n\nYour function should return `true` to keep the comment, or a falsy value\notherwise.\n\n#### Generating a source mapping\n\nYou need to pass the `source_map` argument when calling `print`.  It needs\nto be a `SourceMap` object (which is a thin wrapper on top of the\n[source-map][source-map] library).\n\nExample:\n\n    var source_map = UglifyJS.SourceMap(source_map_options);\n    var stream = UglifyJS.OutputStream({\n        ...\n        source_map: source_map\n    });\n    compressed_ast.print(stream);\n\n    var code = stream.toString();\n    var map = source_map.toString(); // json output for your source map\n\nThe `source_map_options` (optional) can contain the following properties:\n\n- `file`: the name of the JavaScript output file that this mapping refers to\n- `root`: the `sourceRoot` property (see the [spec][sm-spec])\n- `orig`: the \"original source map\", handy when you compress generated JS\n  and want to map the minified output back to the original code where it\n  came from.  It can be simply a string in JSON, or a JSON object containing\n  the original source map.\n\n  [acorn]: https://github.com/marijnh/acorn\n  [source-map]: https://github.com/mozilla/source-map\n  [sm-spec]: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1RGAehQwRypUTovF1KRlpiOFze0b-_2gc6fAH0KY0k/edit\n  [codegen]: http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/codegen\n  [compressor]: http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/compress\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","_id":"uglify-js@2.2.3","dist":{"shasum":"a60c6f7234e971e4522a79d27da006589f8911b4","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/uglify-js/-/uglify-js-2.2.3.tgz"},"_npmVersion":"1.1.66","_npmUser":{"name":"mishoo","email":"mihai.bazon@gmail.com"},"directories":{}},"2.2.4":{"name":"uglify-js","description":"JavaScript parser, mangler/compressor and beautifier toolkit","homepage":"http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs","main":"tools/node.js","version":"2.2.4","engines":{"node":">=0.4.0"},"maintainers":[{"name":"caires","email":"cairesvs@gmail.com"},{"name":"mape","email":"mape@mape.me"},{"name":"mishoo","email":"mihai.bazon@gmail.com"}],"repositories":[{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2.git"}],"dependencies":{"source-map":"~0.1.7","optimist":"~0.3.5"},"bin":{"uglifyjs":"bin/uglifyjs"},"scripts":{"test":"node test/run-tests.js"},"readme":"UglifyJS 2\n==========\n\nUglifyJS is a JavaScript parser, minifier, compressor or beautifier toolkit.\n\nThis page documents the command line utility.

[boolean]\n    --lint             Display some scope warnings                       [boolean]\n    -v, --verbose      Verbose                                           [boolean]\n    -V, --version      Print version number and exit.                    [boolean]\n\nSpecify `--output` (`-o`) to declare the output file.  Otherwise the output\ngoes to STDOUT.\n\n## Source map options\n\nUglifyJS2 can generate a source map file, which is highly useful for\ndebugging your compressed JavaScript.  To get a source map, pass\n`--source-map output.js.map` (full path to the file where you want the\nsource map dumped).\n\nAdditionally you might need `--source-map-root` to pass the URL where the\noriginal files can be found.  In case you are passing full paths to input\nfiles to UglifyJS, you can use `--prefix` (`-p`) to specify the number of\ndirectories to drop from the path prefix when declaring files in the source\nmap.\n\nFor example:\n\n    uglifyjs /home/doe/work/foo/src/js/file1.js \\\n             /home/doe/work/foo/src/js/file2.js \\\n             -o foo.min.js \\\n             --source-map foo.min.js.map \\\n             --source-map-root http://foo.com/src \\\n             -p 5 -c -m\n\nThe above will compress and mangle `file1.js` and `file2.js`, will drop the\noutput in `foo.min.js` and the source map in `foo.min.js.map`.  The source\nmapping will refer to `http://foo.com/src/js/file1.js` and\n`http://foo.com/src/js/file2.js` (in fact it will list `http://foo.com/src`\nas the source map root, and the original files as `js/file1.js` and\n`js/file2.js`).\n\n### Composed source map\n\nWhen you're compressing JS code that was output by a compiler such as\nCoffeeScript, mapping to the JS code won't be too helpful.  Instead, you'd\nlike to map back to the original code (i.e. CoffeeScript).  UglifyJS has an\noption to take an input source map.  Assuming you have a mapping from\nCoffeeScript → compiled JS, UglifyJS can generate a map from CoffeeScript →\ncompressed JS by mapping every token in the compiled JS to its original\nlocation.\n\nTo use this feature you need to pass `--in-source-map\n/path/to/input/source.map`.  Normally the input source map should also point\nto the file containing the generated JS, so if that's correct you can omit\ninput files from the command line.\n\n## Mangler options\n\nTo enable the mangler you need to pass `--mangle` (`-m`).  Optionally you\ncan pass `-m sort=true` (we'll possibly have other flags in the future) in order\nto assign shorter names to most frequently used variables.  This saves a few\nhundred bytes on jQuery before gzip, but the output is _bigger_ after gzip\n(and seems to happen for other libraries I tried it on) therefore it's not\nenabled by default.\n\nWhen mangling is enabled but you want to prevent certain names from being\nmangled, you can declare those names with `--reserved` (`-r`) — pass a\ncomma-separated list of names.  For example:\n\n    uglifyjs ... -m -r '$,require,exports'\n\nto prevent the `require`, `exports` and `$` names from being changed.\n\n## Compressor options\n\nYou need to pass `--compress` (`-c`) to enable the compressor.  Optionally\nyou can pass a comma-separated list of options.  Options are in the form\n`foo=bar`, or just `foo` (the latter implies a boolean option that you want\nto set `true`; it's effectively a shortcut for `foo=true`).\n\nThe defaults should be tuned for maximum compression on most code.  Here are\nthe available options (all are `true` by default, except `hoist_vars`):\n\n- `sequences` -- join consecutive simple statements using the comma operator\n- `properties` -- rewrite property access using the dot notation, for\n  example `foo[\"bar\"] → foo.bar`\n- `dead_code` -- remove unreachable code\n- `drop_debugger` -- remove `debugger;` statements\n- `unsafe` -- apply \"unsafe\" transformations (discussion below)\n- `conditionals` -- apply optimizations for `if`-s and conditional\n  expressions\n- `comparisons` -- apply certain optimizations to binary nodes, for example:\n  `!(a <= b) → a > b` (only when `unsafe`), attempts to negate binary nodes,\n  e.g. `a = !b && !c && !d && !e → a=!(b||c||d||e)` etc.\n- `evaluate` -- attempt to evaluate constant expressions\n- `booleans` -- various optimizations for boolean context, for example `!!a\n  ? b : c → a ? b : c`\n- `loops` -- optimizations for `do`, `while` and `for` loops when we can\n  statically determine the condition\n- `unused` -- drop unreferenced functions and variables\n- `hoist_funs` -- hoist function declarations\n- `hoist_vars` -- hoist `var` declarations (this is `false` by default\n  because it seems to increase the size of the output in general)\n- `if_return` -- optimizations for if/return and if/continue\n- `join_vars` -- join consecutive `var` statements\n- `cascade` -- small optimization for sequences, transform `x, x` into `x`\n  and `x = something(), x` into `x = something()`\n- `warnings` -- display warnings when dropping unreachable code or unused\n  declarations etc.\n\n### Conditional compilation\n\nYou can use the `--define` (`-d`) switch in order to declare global\nvariables that UglifyJS will assume to be constants (unless defined in\nscope).  For example if you pass `--define DEBUG=false` then, coupled with\ndead code removal UglifyJS will discard the following from the output:\n\n    if (DEBUG) {\n        console.log(\"debug stuff\");\n    }\n\nUglifyJS will warn about the condition being always false and about dropping\nunreachable code; for now there is no option to turn off only this specific\nwarning, you can pass `warnings=false` to turn off *all* warnings.\n\nAnother way of doing that is to declare your globals as constants in a\nseparate file and include it into the build.  For example you can have a\n`build/defines.js` file with the following:\n\n    const DEBUG = false;\n    const PRODUCTION = true;\n    // etc.\n\nand build your code like this:\n\n    uglifyjs build/defines.js js/foo.js js/bar.js... -c\n\nUglifyJS will notice the constants and, since they cannot be altered, it\nwill evaluate references to them to the value itself and drop unreachable\ncode as usual.  The possible downside of this approach is that the build\nwill contain the `const` declarations.\n\n<a name=\"codegen-options\"></a>\n## Beautifier options\n\nThe code generator tries to output shortest code possible by default.  In\ncase you want beautified output, pass `--beautify` (`-b`).  Optionally you\ncan pass additional arguments that control the code output:\n\n- `beautify` (default `true`) -- whether to actually beautify the output.\n  Passing `-b` will set this to true, but you might need to pass `-b` even\n  when you want to generate minified code, in order to specify additional\n  arguments, so you can use `-b beautify=false` to override it.\n- `indent-level` (default 4)\n- `indent-start` (default 0) -- prefix all lines by that many spaces\n- `quote-keys` (default `false`) -- pass `true` to quote all keys in literal\n  objects\n- `space-colon` (default `true`) -- insert a space after the colon signs\n- `ascii-only` (default `false`) -- escape Unicode characters in strings and\n  regexps\n- `inline-script` (default `false`) -- escape the slash in occurrences of\n  `</script` in strings\n- `width` (default 80) -- only takes effect when beautification is on, this\n  specifies an (orientative) line width that the beautifier will try to\n  obey.  It refers to the width of the line text (excluding indentation).\n  It doesn't work very well currently, but it does make the code generated\n  by UglifyJS more readable.\n- `max-line-len` (default 32000) -- maximum line length (for uglified code)\n- `ie-proof` (default `true`) -- generate “IE-proof” code (for now this\n  means add brackets around the do/while in code like this: `if (foo) do\n  something(); while (bar); else ...`.\n- `bracketize` (default `false`) -- always insert brackets in `if`, `for`,\n  `do`, `while` or `with` statements, even if their body is a single\n  statement.\n- `semicolons` (default `true`) -- separate statements with semicolons.  If\n  you pass `false` then whenever possible we will use a newline instead of a\n  semicolon, leading to more readable output of uglified code (size before\n  gzip could be smaller; size after gzip insignificantly larger).\n\n### Keeping copyright notices or other comments\n\nYou can pass `--comments` to retain certain comments in the output.  By\ndefault it will keep JSDoc-style comments that contain \"@preserve\",\n\"@license\" or \"@cc_on\" (conditional compilation for IE).  You can pass\n`--comments all` to keep all the comments, or a valid JavaScript regexp to\nkeep only comments that match this regexp.  For example `--comments\n'/foo|bar/'` will keep only comments that contain \"foo\" or \"bar\".\n\nNote, however, that there might be situations where comments are lost.  For\nexample:\n\n    function f() {\n      /** @preserve Foo Bar */\n      function g() {\n        // this function is never called\n      }\n      return something();\n    }\n\nEven though it has \"@preserve\", the comment will be lost because the inner\nfunction `g` (which is the AST node to which the comment is attached to) is\ndiscarded by the compressor as not referenced.\n\nThe safest comments where to place copyright information (or other info that\nneeds to be kept in the output) are comments attached to toplevel nodes.\n\n## Support for the SpiderMonkey AST\n\nUglifyJS2 has its own abstract syntax tree format; for\n[practical reasons](http://lisperator.net/blog/uglifyjs-why-not-switching-to-spidermonkey-ast/)\nwe can't easily change to using the SpiderMonkey AST internally.  However,\nUglifyJS now has a converter which can import a SpiderMonkey AST.\n\nFor example [Acorn][acorn] is a super-fast parser that produces a\nSpiderMonkey AST.  It has a small CLI utility that parses one file and dumps\nthe AST in JSON on the standard output.  To use UglifyJS to mangle and\ncompress that:\n\n    acorn file.js | uglifyjs --spidermonkey -m -c\n\nThe `--spidermonkey` option tells UglifyJS that all input files are not\nJavaScript, but JS code described in SpiderMonkey AST in JSON.  Therefore we\ndon't use our own parser in this case, but just transform that AST into our\ninternal AST.\n\n### Use Acorn for parsing\n\nMore for fun, I added the `--acorn` option which will use Acorn to do all\nthe parsing.  If you pass this option, UglifyJS will `require(\"acorn\")`.\n\nAcorn is really fast (e.g. 250ms instead of 380ms on some 650K code), but\nconverting the SpiderMonkey tree that Acorn produces takes another 150ms so\nin total it's a bit more than just using UglifyJS's own parser.\n\nAPI Reference\n-------------\n\nAssuming installation via NPM, you can load UglifyJS in your application\nlike this:\n\n    var UglifyJS = require(\"uglify-js\");\n\nIt exports a lot of names, but I'll discuss here the basics that are needed\nfor parsing, mangling and compressing a piece of code.  The sequence is (1)\nparse, (2) compress, (3) mangle, (4) generate output code.\n\n### The simple way\n\nThere's a single toplevel function which combines all the steps.  If you\ndon't need additional customization, you might want to go with `minify`.\nExample:\n\n    var result = UglifyJS.minify(\"/path/to/file.js\");\n    console.log(result.code); // minified output\n    // if you need to pass code instead of file name\n    var result = UglifyJS.minify(\"var b = function () {};\", {fromString: true});\n\nYou can also compress multiple files:\n\n    var result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ]);\n    console.log(result.code);\n\nTo generate a source map:\n\n    var result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ], {\n        outSourceMap: \"out.js.map\"\n    });\n    console.log(result.code); // minified output\n    console.log(result.map);\n\nNote that the source map is not saved in a file, it's just returned in\n`result.map`.  The value passed for `outSourceMap` is only used to set the\n`file` attribute in the source map (see [the spec][sm-spec]).\n\nYou can also specify sourceRoot property to be included in source map:\n\n    var result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ], {\n        outSourceMap: \"out.js.map\",\n        sourceRoot: \"http://example.com/src\"\n    });\n\n\nIf you're compressing compiled JavaScript and have a source map for it, you\ncan use the `inSourceMap` argument:\n\n    var result = UglifyJS.minify(\"compiled.js\", {\n        inSourceMap: \"compiled.js.map\",\n        outSourceMap: \"minified.js.map\"\n    });\n    // same as before, it returns `code` and `map`\n\nThe `inSourceMap` is only used if you also request `outSourceMap` (it makes\nno sense otherwise).\n\nOther options:\n\n- `warnings` (default `false`) — pass `true` to display compressor warnings.\n\n- `fromString` (default `false`) — if you pass `true` then you can pass\n  JavaScript source code, rather than file names.\n\n- `mangle` — pass `false` to skip mangling names.\n\n- `output` (default `null`) — pass an object if you wish to specify\n  additional [output options][codegen].  The defaults are optimized\n  for best compression.\n\n- `compress` (default `{}`) — pass `false` to skip compressing entirely.\n  Pass an object to specify custom [compressor options][compressor].\n\nWe could add more options to `UglifyJS.minify` — if you need additional\nfunctionality please suggest!\n\n### The hard way\n\nFollowing there's more detailed API info, in case the `minify` function is\ntoo simple for your needs.\n\n#### The parser\n\n    var toplevel_ast = UglifyJS.parse(code, options);\n\n`options` is optional and if present it must be an object.  The following\nproperties are available:\n\n- `strict` — disable automatic semicolon insertion and support for trailing\n  comma in arrays and objects\n- `filename` — the name of the file where this code is coming from\n- `toplevel` — a `toplevel` node (as returned by a previous invocation of\n  `parse`)\n\nThe last two options are useful when you'd like to minify multiple files and\nget a single file as the output and a proper source map.  Our CLI tool does\nsomething like this:\n\n    var toplevel = null;\n    files.forEach(function(file){\n        var code = fs.readFileSync(file);\n        toplevel = UglifyJS.parse(code, {\n            filename: file,\n            toplevel: toplevel\n        });\n    });\n\nAfter this, we have in `toplevel` a big AST containing all our files, with\neach token having proper information about where it came from.\n\n#### Scope information\n\nUglifyJS contains a scope analyzer that you need to call manually before\ncompressing or mangling.  Basically it augments various nodes in the AST\nwith information about where is a name defined, how many times is a name\nreferenced, if it is a global or not, if a function is using `eval` or the\n`with` statement etc.  I will discuss this some place else, for now what's\nimportant to know is that you need to call the following before doing\nanything with the tree:\n\n    toplevel.figure_out_scope()\n\n#### Compression\n\nLike this:\n\n    var compressor = UglifyJS.Compressor(options);\n    var compressed_ast = toplevel.transform(compressor);\n\nThe `options` can be missing.  Available options are discussed above in\n“Compressor options”.  Defaults should lead to best compression in most\nscripts.\n\nThe compressor is destructive, so don't rely that `toplevel` remains the\noriginal tree.\n\n#### Mangling\n\nAfter compression it is a good idea to call again `figure_out_scope` (since\nthe compressor might drop unused variables / unreachable code and this might\nchange the number of identifiers or their position).  Optionally, you can\ncall a trick that helps after Gzip (counting character frequency in\nnon-mangleable words).  Example:\n\n    compressed_ast.figure_out_scope();\n    compressed_ast.compute_char_frequency();\n    compressed_ast.mangle_names();\n\n#### Generating output\n\nAST nodes have a `print` method that takes an output stream.  Essentially,\nto generate code you do this:\n\n    var stream = UglifyJS.OutputStream(options);\n    compressed_ast.print(stream);\n    var code = stream.toString(); // this is your minified code\n\nor, for a shortcut you can do:\n\n    var code = compressed_ast.print_to_string(options);\n\nAs usual, `options` is optional.  The output stream accepts a lot of otions,\nmost of them documented above in section “Beautifier options”.  The two\nwhich we care about here are `source_map` and `comments`.\n\n#### Keeping comments in the output\n\nIn order to keep certain comments in the output you need to pass the\n`comments` option.  Pass a RegExp or a function.  If you pass a RegExp, only\nthose comments whose body matches the regexp will be kept.  Note that body\nmeans without the initial `//` or `/*`.  If you pass a function, it will be\ncalled for every comment in the tree and will receive two arguments: the\nnode that the comment is attached to, and the comment token itself.\n\nThe comment token has these properties:\n\n- `type`: \"comment1\" for single-line comments or \"comment2\" for multi-line\n  comments\n- `value`: the comment body\n- `pos` and `endpos`: the start/end positions (zero-based indexes) in the\n  original code where this comment appears\n- `line` and `col`: the line and column where this comment appears in the\n  original code\n- `file` — the file name of the original file\n- `nlb` — true if there was a newline before this comment in the original\n  code, or if this comment contains a newline.\n\nYour function should return `true` to keep the comment, or a falsy value\notherwise.\n\n#### Generating a source mapping\n\nYou need to pass the `source_map` argument when calling `print`.  It needs\nto be a `SourceMap` object (which is a thin wrapper on top of the\n[source-map][source-map] library).\n\nExample:\n\n    var source_map = UglifyJS.SourceMap(source_map_options);\n    var stream = UglifyJS.OutputStream({\n        ...\n        source_map: source_map\n    });\n    compressed_ast.print(stream);\n\n    var code = stream.toString();\n    var map = source_map.toString(); // json output for your source map\n\nThe `source_map_options` (optional) can contain the following properties:\n\n- `file`: the name of the JavaScript output file that this mapping refers to\n- `root`: the `sourceRoot` property (see the [spec][sm-spec])\n- `orig`: the \"original source map\", handy when you compress generated JS\n  and want to map the minified output back to the original code where it\n  came from.  It can be simply a string in JSON, or a JSON object containing\n  the original source map.\n\n  [acorn]: https://github.com/marijnh/acorn\n  [source-map]: https://github.com/mozilla/source-map\n  [sm-spec]: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1RGAehQwRypUTovF1KRlpiOFze0b-_2gc6fAH0KY0k/edit\n  [codegen]: http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/codegen\n  [compressor]: http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/compress\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","_id":"uglify-js@2.2.4","dist":{"shasum":"805b40fa468b1fad4da84f3e04cd0ca26bf80a29","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/uglify-js/-/uglify-js-2.2.4.tgz"},"_npmVersion":"1.1.66","_npmUser":{"name":"mishoo","email":"mihai.bazon@gmail.com"},"directories":{}},"2.2.5":{"name":"uglify-js","description":"JavaScript parser, mangler/compressor and beautifier toolkit","homepage":"http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs","main":"tools/node.js","version":"2.2.5","engines":{"node":">=0.4.0"},"maintainers":[{"name":"caires","email":"cairesvs@gmail.com"},{"name":"mape","email":"mape@mape.me"},{"name":"mishoo","email":"mihai.bazon@gmail.com"}],"repositories":[{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2.git"}],"dependencies":{"source-map":"~0.1.7","optimist":"~0.3.5"},"bin":{"uglifyjs":"bin/uglifyjs"},"scripts":{"test":"node test/run-tests.js"},"readme":"UglifyJS 2\n==========\n\nUglifyJS is a JavaScript parser, minifier, compressor or beautifier toolkit.\n\nThis page documents the command line utility.

You can optionally\n                       pass one of the following arguments to this flag:\n                       - \"all\" to keep all comments\n                       - a valid JS regexp (needs to start with a slash) to keep\n                       only comments that match.\n                       Note that currently not *all* comments can be kept when\n                       compression is on, because of dead code removal or\n                       cascading statements into sequences.               [string]\n    --stats            Display operations run time on STDERR.            [boolean]\n    --acorn            Use Acorn for parsing.                            [boolean]\n    --spidermonkey     Assume input fles are SpiderMonkey AST format (as JSON).\n                                                                         [boolean]\n    --self             Build itself (UglifyJS2) as a library (implies\n                       --wrap=UglifyJS --export-all)                     [boolean]\n    --wrap             Embed everything in a big function, making the “exports”\n                       and “global” variables available. You need to pass an\n                       argument to this option to specify the name that your\n                       module will take when included in, say, a browser.\n                                                                          [string]\n    --export-all       Only used when --wrap, this tells UglifyJS to add code to\n                       automatically export all globals.                 [boolean]\n    --lint             Display some scope warnings                       [boolean]\n    -v, --verbose      Verbose                                           [boolean]\n    -V, --version      Print version number and exit.                    [boolean]\n\nSpecify `--output` (`-o`) to declare the output file.  Otherwise the output\ngoes to STDOUT.\n\n## Source map options\n\nUglifyJS2 can generate a source map file, which is highly useful for\ndebugging your compressed JavaScript.  To get a source map, pass\n`--source-map output.js.map` (full path to the file where you want the\nsource map dumped).\n\nAdditionally you might need `--source-map-root` to pass the URL where the\noriginal files can be found.  In case you are passing full paths to input\nfiles to UglifyJS, you can use `--prefix` (`-p`) to specify the number of\ndirectories to drop from the path prefix when declaring files in the source\nmap.\n\nFor example:\n\n    uglifyjs /home/doe/work/foo/src/js/file1.js \\\n             /home/doe/work/foo/src/js/file2.js \\\n             -o foo.min.js \\\n             --source-map foo.min.js.map \\\n             --source-map-root http://foo.com/src \\\n             -p 5 -c -m\n\nThe above will compress and mangle `file1.js` and `file2.js`, will drop the\noutput in `foo.min.js` and the source map in `foo.min.js.map`.  The source\nmapping will refer to `http://foo.com/src/js/file1.js` and\n`http://foo.com/src/js/file2.js` (in fact it will list `http://foo.com/src`\nas the source map root, and the original files as `js/file1.js` and\n`js/file2.js`).\n\n### Composed source map\n\nWhen you're compressing JS code that was output by a compiler such as\nCoffeeScript, mapping to the JS code won't be too helpful.  Instead, you'd\nlike to map back to the original code (i.e. CoffeeScript).  UglifyJS has an\noption to take an input source map.  Assuming you have a mapping from\nCoffeeScript → compiled JS, UglifyJS can generate a map from CoffeeScript →\ncompressed JS by mapping every token in the compiled JS to its original\nlocation.\n\nTo use this feature you need to pass `--in-source-map\n/path/to/input/source.map`.  Normally the input source map should also point\nto the file containing the generated JS, so if that's correct you can omit\ninput files from the command line.\n\n## Mangler options\n\nTo enable the mangler you need to pass `--mangle` (`-m`).  Optionally you\ncan pass `-m sort=true` (we'll possibly have other flags in the future) in order\nto assign shorter names to most frequently used variables.  This saves a few\nhundred bytes on jQuery before gzip, but the output is _bigger_ after gzip\n(and seems to happen for other libraries I tried it on) therefore it's not\nenabled by default.\n\nWhen mangling is enabled but you want to prevent certain names from being\nmangled, you can declare those names with `--reserved` (`-r`) — pass a\ncomma-separated list of names.  For example:\n\n    uglifyjs ... -m -r '$,require,exports'\n\nto prevent the `require`, `exports` and `$` names from being changed.\n\n## Compressor options\n\nYou need to pass `--compress` (`-c`) to enable the compressor.  Optionally\nyou can pass a comma-separated list of options.  Options are in the form\n`foo=bar`, or just `foo` (the latter implies a boolean option that you want\nto set `true`; it's effectively a shortcut for `foo=true`).\n\nThe defaults should be tuned for maximum compression on most code.  Here are\nthe available options (all are `true` by default, except `hoist_vars`):\n\n- `sequences` -- join consecutive simple statements using the comma operator\n- `properties` -- rewrite property access using the dot notation, for\n  example `foo[\"bar\"] → foo.bar`\n- `dead_code` -- remove unreachable code\n- `drop_debugger` -- remove `debugger;` statements\n- `unsafe` -- apply \"unsafe\" transformations (discussion below)\n- `conditionals` -- apply optimizations for `if`-s and conditional\n  expressions\n- `comparisons` -- apply certain optimizations to binary nodes, for example:\n  `!(a <= b) → a > b` (only when `unsafe`), attempts to negate binary nodes,\n  e.g. `a = !b && !c && !d && !e → a=!(b||c||d||e)` etc.\n- `evaluate` -- attempt to evaluate constant expressions\n- `booleans` -- various optimizations for boolean context, for example `!!a\n  ? b : c → a ? b : c`\n- `loops` -- optimizations for `do`, `while` and `for` loops when we can\n  statically determine the condition\n- `unused` -- drop unreferenced functions and variables\n- `hoist_funs` -- hoist function declarations\n- `hoist_vars` -- hoist `var` declarations (this is `false` by default\n  because it seems to increase the size of the output in general)\n- `if_return` -- optimizations for if/return and if/continue\n- `join_vars` -- join consecutive `var` statements\n- `cascade` -- small optimization for sequences, transform `x, x` into `x`\n  and `x = something(), x` into `x = something()`\n- `warnings` -- display warnings when dropping unreachable code or unused\n  declarations etc.\n\n### Conditional compilation\n\nYou can use the `--define` (`-d`) switch in order to declare global\nvariables that UglifyJS will assume to be constants (unless defined in\nscope).  For example if you pass `--define DEBUG=false` then, coupled with\ndead code removal UglifyJS will discard the following from the output:\n\n    if (DEBUG) {\n        console.log(\"debug stuff\");\n    }\n\nUglifyJS will warn about the condition being always false and about dropping\nunreachable code; for now there is no option to turn off only this specific\nwarning, you can pass `warnings=false` to turn off *all* warnings.\n\nAnother way of doing that is to declare your globals as constants in a\nseparate file and include it into the build.  For example you can have a\n`build/defines.js` file with the following:\n\n    const DEBUG = false;\n    const PRODUCTION = true;\n    // etc.\n\nand build your code like this:\n\n    uglifyjs build/defines.js js/foo.js js/bar.js... -c\n\nUglifyJS will notice the constants and, since they cannot be altered, it\nwill evaluate references to them to the value itself and drop unreachable\ncode as usual.  The possible downside of this approach is that the build\nwill contain the `const` declarations.\n\n<a name=\"codegen-options\"></a>\n## Beautifier options\n\nThe code generator tries to output shortest code possible by default.  In\ncase you want beautified output, pass `--beautify` (`-b`).  Optionally you\ncan pass additional arguments that control the code output:\n\n- `beautify` (default `true`) -- whether to actually beautify the output.\n  Passing `-b` will set this to true, but you might need to pass `-b` even\n  when you want to generate minified code, in order to specify additional\n  arguments, so you can use `-b beautify=false` to override it.\n- `indent-level` (default 4)\n- `indent-start` (default 0) -- prefix all lines by that many spaces\n- `quote-keys` (default `false`) -- pass `true` to quote all keys in literal\n  objects\n- `space-colon` (default `true`) -- insert a space after the colon signs\n- `ascii-only` (default `false`) -- escape Unicode characters in strings and\n  regexps\n- `inline-script` (default `false`) -- escape the slash in occurrences of\n  `</script` in strings\n- `width` (default 80) -- only takes effect when beautification is on, this\n  specifies an (orientative) line width that the beautifier will try to\n  obey.  It refers to the width of the line text (excluding indentation).\n  It doesn't work very well currently, but it does make the code generated\n  by UglifyJS more readable.\n- `max-line-len` (default 32000) -- maximum line length (for uglified code)\n- `ie-proof` (default `true`) -- generate “IE-proof” code (for now this\n  means add brackets around the do/while in code like this: `if (foo) do\n  something(); while (bar); else ...`.\n- `bracketize` (default `false`) -- always insert brackets in `if`, `for`,\n  `do`, `while` or `with` statements, even if their body is a single\n  statement.\n- `semicolons` (default `true`) -- separate statements with semicolons.  If\n  you pass `false` then whenever possible we will use a newline instead of a\n  semicolon, leading to more readable output of uglified code (size before\n  gzip could be smaller; size after gzip insignificantly larger).\n\n### Keeping copyright notices or other comments\n\nYou can pass `--comments` to retain certain comments in the output.  By\ndefault it will keep JSDoc-style comments that contain \"@preserve\",\n\"@license\" or \"@cc_on\" (conditional compilation for IE).  You can pass\n`--comments all` to keep all the comments, or a valid JavaScript regexp to\nkeep only comments that match this regexp.  For example `--comments\n'/foo|bar/'` will keep only comments that contain \"foo\" or \"bar\".\n\nNote, however, that there might be situations where comments are lost.  For\nexample:\n\n    function f() {\n      /** @preserve Foo Bar */\n      function g() {\n        // this function is never called\n      }\n      return something();\n    }\n\nEven though it has \"@preserve\", the comment will be lost because the inner\nfunction `g` (which is the AST node to which the comment is attached to) is\ndiscarded by the compressor as not referenced.\n\nThe safest comments where to place copyright information (or other info that\nneeds to be kept in the output) are comments attached to toplevel nodes.\n\n## Support for the SpiderMonkey AST\n\nUglifyJS2 has its own abstract syntax tree format; for\n[practical reasons](http://lisperator.net/blog/uglifyjs-why-not-switching-to-spidermonkey-ast/)\nwe can't easily change to using the SpiderMonkey AST internally.  However,\nUglifyJS now has a converter which can import a SpiderMonkey AST.\n\nFor example [Acorn][acorn] is a super-fast parser that produces a\nSpiderMonkey AST.  It has a small CLI utility that parses one file and dumps\nthe AST in JSON on the standard output.  To use UglifyJS to mangle and\ncompress that:\n\n    acorn file.js | uglifyjs --spidermonkey -m -c\n\nThe `--spidermonkey` option tells UglifyJS that all input files are not\nJavaScript, but JS code described in SpiderMonkey AST in JSON.  Therefore we\ndon't use our own parser in this case, but just transform that AST into our\ninternal AST.\n\n### Use Acorn for parsing\n\nMore for fun, I added the `--acorn` option which will use Acorn to do all\nthe parsing.  If you pass this option, UglifyJS will `require(\"acorn\")`.\n\nAcorn is really fast (e.g. 250ms instead of 380ms on some 650K code), but\nconverting the SpiderMonkey tree that Acorn produces takes another 150ms so\nin total it's a bit more than just using UglifyJS's own parser.\n\nAPI Reference\n-------------\n\nAssuming installation via NPM, you can load UglifyJS in your application\nlike this:\n\n    var UglifyJS = require(\"uglify-js\");\n\nIt exports a lot of names, but I'll discuss here the basics that are needed\nfor parsing, mangling and compressing a piece of code.  The sequence is (1)\nparse, (2) compress, (3) mangle, (4) generate output code.\n\n### The simple way\n\nThere's a single toplevel function which combines all the steps.  If you\ndon't need additional customization, you might want to go with `minify`.\nExample:\n\n    var result = UglifyJS.minify(\"/path/to/file.js\");\n    console.log(result.code); // minified output\n    // if you need to pass code instead of file name\n    var result = UglifyJS.minify(\"var b = function () {};\", {fromString: true});\n\nYou can also compress multiple files:\n\n    var result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ]);\n    console.log(result.code);\n\nTo generate a source map:\n\n    var result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ], {\n        outSourceMap: \"out.js.map\"\n    });\n    console.log(result.code); // minified output\n    console.log(result.map);\n\nNote that the source map is not saved in a file, it's just returned in\n`result.map`.  The value passed for `outSourceMap` is only used to set the\n`file` attribute in the source map (see [the spec][sm-spec]).\n\nYou can also specify sourceRoot property to be included in source map:\n\n    var result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ], {\n        outSourceMap: \"out.js.map\",\n        sourceRoot: \"http://example.com/src\"\n    });\n\n\nIf you're compressing compiled JavaScript and have a source map for it, you\ncan use the `inSourceMap` argument:\n\n    var result = UglifyJS.minify(\"compiled.js\", {\n        inSourceMap: \"compiled.js.map\",\n        outSourceMap: \"minified.js.map\"\n    });\n    // same as before, it returns `code` and `map`\n\nThe `inSourceMap` is only used if you also request `outSourceMap` (it makes\nno sense otherwise).\n\nOther options:\n\n- `warnings` (default `false`) — pass `true` to display compressor warnings.\n\n- `fromString` (default `false`) — if you pass `true` then you can pass\n  JavaScript source code, rather than file names.\n\n- `mangle` — pass `false` to skip mangling names.\n\n- `output` (default `null`) — pass an object if you wish to specify\n  additional [output options][codegen].  The defaults are optimized\n  for best compression.\n\n- `compress` (default `{}`) — pass `false` to skip compressing entirely.\n  Pass an object to specify custom [compressor options][compressor].\n\nWe could add more options to `UglifyJS.minify` — if you need additional\nfunctionality please suggest!\n\n### The hard way\n\nFollowing there's more detailed API info, in case the `minify` function is\ntoo simple for your needs.\n\n#### The parser\n\n    var toplevel_ast = UglifyJS.parse(code, options);\n\n`options` is optional and if present it must be an object.  The following\nproperties are available:\n\n- `strict` — disable automatic semicolon insertion and support for trailing\n  comma in arrays and objects\n- `filename` — the name of the file where this code is coming from\n- `toplevel` — a `toplevel` node (as returned by a previous invocation of\n  `parse`)\n\nThe last two options are useful when you'd like to minify multiple files and\nget a single file as the output and a proper source map.  Our CLI tool does\nsomething like this:\n\n    var toplevel = null;\n    files.forEach(function(file){\n        var code = fs.readFileSync(file);\n        toplevel = UglifyJS.parse(code, {\n            filename: file,\n            toplevel: toplevel\n        });\n    });\n\nAfter this, we have in `toplevel` a big AST containing all our files, with\neach token having proper information about where it came from.\n\n#### Scope information\n\nUglifyJS contains a scope analyzer that you need to call manually before\ncompressing or mangling.  Basically it augments various nodes in the AST\nwith information about where is a name defined, how many times is a name\nreferenced, if it is a global or not, if a function is using `eval` or the\n`with` statement etc.  I will discuss this some place else, for now what's\nimportant to know is that you need to call the following before doing\nanything with the tree:\n\n    toplevel.figure_out_scope()\n\n#### Compression\n\nLike this:\n\n    var compressor = UglifyJS.Compressor(options);\n    var compressed_ast = toplevel.transform(compressor);\n\nThe `options` can be missing.  Available options are discussed above in\n“Compressor options”.  Defaults should lead to best compression in most\nscripts.\n\nThe compressor is destructive, so don't rely that `toplevel` remains the\noriginal tree.\n\n#### Mangling\n\nAfter compression it is a good idea to call again `figure_out_scope` (since\nthe compressor might drop unused variables / unreachable code and this might\nchange the number of identifiers or their position).  Optionally, you can\ncall a trick that helps after Gzip (counting character frequency in\nnon-mangleable words).  Example:\n\n    compressed_ast.figure_out_scope();\n    compressed_ast.compute_char_frequency();\n    compressed_ast.mangle_names();\n\n#### Generating output\n\nAST nodes have a `print` method that takes an output stream.  Essentially,\nto generate code you do this:\n\n    var stream = UglifyJS.OutputStream(options);\n    compressed_ast.print(stream);\n    var code = stream.toString(); // this is your minified code\n\nor, for a shortcut you can do:\n\n    var code = compressed_ast.print_to_string(options);\n\nAs usual, `options` is optional.  The output stream accepts a lot of otions,\nmost of them documented above in section “Beautifier options”.  The two\nwhich we care about here are `source_map` and `comments`.\n\n#### Keeping comments in the output\n\nIn order to keep certain comments in the output you need to pass the\n`comments` option.  Pass a RegExp or a function.  If you pass a RegExp, only\nthose comments whose body matches the regexp will be kept.  Note that body\nmeans without the initial `//` or `/*`.  If you pass a function, it will be\ncalled for every comment in the tree and will receive two arguments: the\nnode that the comment is attached to, and the comment token itself.\n\nThe comment token has these properties:\n\n- `type`: \"comment1\" for single-line comments or \"comment2\" for multi-line\n  comments\n- `value`: the comment body\n- `pos` and `endpos`: the start/end positions (zero-based indexes) in the\n  original code where this comment appears\n- `line` and `col`: the line and column where this comment appears in the\n  original code\n- `file` — the file name of the original file\n- `nlb` — true if there was a newline before this comment in the original\n  code, or if this comment contains a newline.\n\nYour function should return `true` to keep the comment, or a falsy value\notherwise.\n\n#### Generating a source mapping\n\nYou need to pass the `source_map` argument when calling `print`.  It needs\nto be a `SourceMap` object (which is a thin wrapper on top of the\n[source-map][source-map] library).\n\nExample:\n\n    var source_map = UglifyJS.SourceMap(source_map_options);\n    var stream = UglifyJS.OutputStream({\n        ...\n        source_map: source_map\n    });\n    compressed_ast.print(stream);\n\n    var code = stream.toString();\n    var map = source_map.toString(); // json output for your source map\n\nThe `source_map_options` (optional) can contain the following properties:\n\n- `file`: the name of the JavaScript output file that this mapping refers to\n- `root`: the `sourceRoot` property (see the [spec][sm-spec])\n- `orig`: the \"original source map\", handy when you compress generated JS\n  and want to map the minified output back to the original code where it\n  came from.  It can be simply a string in JSON, or a JSON object containing\n  the original source map.\n\n  [acorn]: https://github.com/marijnh/acorn\n  [source-map]: https://github.com/mozilla/source-map\n  [sm-spec]: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1RGAehQwRypUTovF1KRlpiOFze0b-_2gc6fAH0KY0k/edit\n  [codegen]: http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/codegen\n  [compressor]: http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/compress\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","_id":"uglify-js@2.2.5","dist":{"shasum":"a6e02a70d839792b9780488b7b8b184c095c99c7","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/uglify-js/-/uglify-js-2.2.5.tgz"},"_npmVersion":"1.1.66","_npmUser":{"name":"mishoo","email":"mihai.bazon@gmail.com"},"directories":{}},"2.3.0":{"name":"uglify-js","description":"JavaScript parser, mangler/compressor and beautifier toolkit","homepage":"http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs","main":"tools/node.js","version":"2.3.0","engines":{"node":">=0.4.0"},"maintainers":[{"name":"caires","email":"cairesvs@gmail.com"},{"name":"mape","email":"mape@mape.me"},{"name":"mishoo","email":"mihai.bazon@gmail.com"}],"repositories":[{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2.git"}],"dependencies":{"async":"~0.2.6","source-map":"~0.1.7","optimist":"~0.3.5"},"bin":{"uglifyjs":"bin/uglifyjs"},"scripts":{"test":"node test/run-tests.js"},"readme":"UglifyJS 2\n==========\n\nUglifyJS is a JavaScript parser, minifier, compressor or beautifier toolkit.\n\nThis page documents the command line utility.

[boolean]\n\nSpecify `--output` (`-o`) to declare the output file.  Otherwise the output\ngoes to STDOUT.\n\n## Source map options\n\nUglifyJS2 can generate a source map file, which is highly useful for\ndebugging your compressed JavaScript.  To get a source map, pass\n`--source-map output.js.map` (full path to the file where you want the\nsource map dumped).\n\nAdditionally you might need `--source-map-root` to pass the URL where the\noriginal files can be found.  In case you are passing full paths to input\nfiles to UglifyJS, you can use `--prefix` (`-p`) to specify the number of\ndirectories to drop from the path prefix when declaring files in the source\nmap.\n\nFor example:\n\n    uglifyjs /home/doe/work/foo/src/js/file1.js \\\n             /home/doe/work/foo/src/js/file2.js \\\n             -o foo.min.js \\\n             --source-map foo.min.js.map \\\n             --source-map-root http://foo.com/src \\\n             -p 5 -c -m\n\nThe above will compress and mangle `file1.js` and `file2.js`, will drop the\noutput in `foo.min.js` and the source map in `foo.min.js.map`.  The source\nmapping will refer to `http://foo.com/src/js/file1.js` and\n`http://foo.com/src/js/file2.js` (in fact it will list `http://foo.com/src`\nas the source map root, and the original files as `js/file1.js` and\n`js/file2.js`).\n\n### Composed source map\n\nWhen you're compressing JS code that was output by a compiler such as\nCoffeeScript, mapping to the JS code won't be too helpful.  Instead, you'd\nlike to map back to the original code (i.e. CoffeeScript).  UglifyJS has an\noption to take an input source map.  Assuming you have a mapping from\nCoffeeScript → compiled JS, UglifyJS can generate a map from CoffeeScript →\ncompressed JS by mapping every token in the compiled JS to its original\nlocation.\n\nTo use this feature you need to pass `--in-source-map\n/path/to/input/source.map`.  Normally the input source map should also point\nto the file containing the generated JS, so if that's correct you can omit\ninput files from the command line.\n\n## Mangler options\n\nTo enable the mangler you need to pass `--mangle` (`-m`).  The following\n(comma-separated) options are supported:\n\n- `sort` — to assign shorter names to most frequently used variables.  This\n  saves a few hundred bytes on jQuery before gzip, but the output is\n  _bigger_ after gzip (and seems to happen for other libraries I tried it\n  on) therefore it's not enabled by default.\n\n- `toplevel` — mangle names declared in the toplevel scope (disabled by\n  default).\n\n- `eval` — mangle names visible in scopes where `eval` or `when` are used\n  (disabled by default).\n\nWhen mangling is enabled but you want to prevent certain names from being\nmangled, you can declare those names with `--reserved` (`-r`) — pass a\ncomma-separated list of names.  For example:\n\n    uglifyjs ... -m -r '$,require,exports'\n\nto prevent the `require`, `exports` and `$` names from being changed.\n\n## Compressor options\n\nYou need to pass `--compress` (`-c`) to enable the compressor.  Optionally\nyou can pass a comma-separated list of options.  Options are in the form\n`foo=bar`, or just `foo` (the latter implies a boolean option that you want\nto set `true`; it's effectively a shortcut for `foo=true`).\n\n- `sequences` -- join consecutive simple statements using the comma operator\n- `properties` -- rewrite property access using the dot notation, for\n  example `foo[\"bar\"] → foo.bar`\n- `dead_code` -- remove unreachable code\n- `drop_debugger` -- remove `debugger;` statements\n- `unsafe` (default: false) -- apply \"unsafe\" transformations (discussion below)\n- `conditionals` -- apply optimizations for `if`-s and conditional\n  expressions\n- `comparisons` -- apply certain optimizations to binary nodes, for example:\n  `!(a <= b) → a > b` (only when `unsafe`), attempts to negate binary nodes,\n  e.g. `a = !b && !c && !d && !e → a=!(b||c||d||e)` etc.\n- `evaluate` -- attempt to evaluate constant expressions\n- `booleans` -- various optimizations for boolean context, for example `!!a\n  ? b : c → a ? b : c`\n- `loops` -- optimizations for `do`, `while` and `for` loops when we can\n  statically determine the condition\n- `unused` -- drop unreferenced functions and variables\n- `hoist_funs` -- hoist function declarations\n- `hoist_vars` (default: false) -- hoist `var` declarations (this is `false`\n  by default because it seems to increase the size of the output in general)\n- `if_return` -- optimizations for if/return and if/continue\n- `join_vars` -- join consecutive `var` statements\n- `cascade` -- small optimization for sequences, transform `x, x` into `x`\n  and `x = something(), x` into `x = something()`\n- `warnings` -- display warnings when dropping unreachable code or unused\n  declarations etc.\n\n### The `unsafe` option\n\nIt enables some transformations that *might* break code logic in certain\ncontrived cases, but should be fine for most code.  You might want to try it\non your own code, it should reduce the minified size.  Here's what happens\nwhen this flag is on:\n\n- `new Array(1, 2, 3)` or `Array(1, 2, 3)` → `[1, 2, 3 ]`\n- `new Object()` → `{}`\n- `String(exp)` or `exp.toString()` → `\"\" + exp`\n- `new Object/RegExp/Function/Error/Array (...)` → we discard the `new`\n- `typeof foo == \"undefined\"` → `foo === void 0`\n- `void 0` → `\"undefined\"` (if there is a variable named \"undefined\" in\n  scope; we do it because the variable name will be mangled, typically\n  reduced to a single character).\n\n### Conditional compilation\n\nYou can use the `--define` (`-d`) switch in order to declare global\nvariables that UglifyJS will assume to be constants (unless defined in\nscope).  For example if you pass `--define DEBUG=false` then, coupled with\ndead code removal UglifyJS will discard the following from the output:\n\n    if (DEBUG) {\n        console.log(\"debug stuff\");\n    }\n\nUglifyJS will warn about the condition being always false and about dropping\nunreachable code; for now there is no option to turn off only this specific\nwarning, you can pass `warnings=false` to turn off *all* warnings.\n\nAnother way of doing that is to declare your globals as constants in a\nseparate file and include it into the build.  For example you can have a\n`build/defines.js` file with the following:\n\n    const DEBUG = false;\n    const PRODUCTION = true;\n    // etc.\n\nand build your code like this:\n\n    uglifyjs build/defines.js js/foo.js js/bar.js... -c\n\nUglifyJS will notice the constants and, since they cannot be altered, it\nwill evaluate references to them to the value itself and drop unreachable\ncode as usual.  The possible downside of this approach is that the build\nwill contain the `const` declarations.\n\n<a name=\"codegen-options\"></a>\n## Beautifier options\n\nThe code generator tries to output shortest code possible by default.  In\ncase you want beautified output, pass `--beautify` (`-b`).  Optionally you\ncan pass additional arguments that control the code output:\n\n- `beautify` (default `true`) -- whether to actually beautify the output.\n  Passing `-b` will set this to true, but you might need to pass `-b` even\n  when you want to generate minified code, in order to specify additional\n  arguments, so you can use `-b beautify=false` to override it.\n- `indent-level` (default 4)\n- `indent-start` (default 0) -- prefix all lines by that many spaces\n- `quote-keys` (default `false`) -- pass `true` to quote all keys in literal\n  objects\n- `space-colon` (default `true`) -- insert a space after the colon signs\n- `ascii-only` (default `false`) -- escape Unicode characters in strings and\n  regexps\n- `inline-script` (default `false`) -- escape the slash in occurrences of\n  `</script` in strings\n- `width` (default 80) -- only takes effect when beautification is on, this\n  specifies an (orientative) line width that the beautifier will try to\n  obey.  It refers to the width of the line text (excluding indentation).\n  It doesn't work very well currently, but it does make the code generated\n  by UglifyJS more readable.\n- `max-line-len` (default 32000) -- maximum line length (for uglified code)\n- `ie-proof` (default `true`) -- generate “IE-proof” code (for now this\n  means add brackets around the do/while in code like this: `if (foo) do\n  something(); while (bar); else ...`.\n- `bracketize` (default `false`) -- always insert brackets in `if`, `for`,\n  `do`, `while` or `with` statements, even if their body is a single\n  statement.\n- `semicolons` (default `true`) -- separate statements with semicolons.  If\n  you pass `false` then whenever possible we will use a newline instead of a\n  semicolon, leading to more readable output of uglified code (size before\n  gzip could be smaller; size after gzip insignificantly larger).\n\n### Keeping copyright notices or other comments\n\nYou can pass `--comments` to retain certain comments in the output.  By\ndefault it will keep JSDoc-style comments that contain \"@preserve\",\n\"@license\" or \"@cc_on\" (conditional compilation for IE).  You can pass\n`--comments all` to keep all the comments, or a valid JavaScript regexp to\nkeep only comments that match this regexp.  For example `--comments\n'/foo|bar/'` will keep only comments that contain \"foo\" or \"bar\".\n\nNote, however, that there might be situations where comments are lost.  For\nexample:\n\n    function f() {\n      /** @preserve Foo Bar */\n      function g() {\n        // this function is never called\n      }\n      return something();\n    }\n\nEven though it has \"@preserve\", the comment will be lost because the inner\nfunction `g` (which is the AST node to which the comment is attached to) is\ndiscarded by the compressor as not referenced.\n\nThe safest comments where to place copyright information (or other info that\nneeds to be kept in the output) are comments attached to toplevel nodes.\n\n## Support for the SpiderMonkey AST\n\nUglifyJS2 has its own abstract syntax tree format; for\n[practical reasons](http://lisperator.net/blog/uglifyjs-why-not-switching-to-spidermonkey-ast/)\nwe can't easily change to using the SpiderMonkey AST internally.  However,\nUglifyJS now has a converter which can import a SpiderMonkey AST.\n\nFor example [Acorn][acorn] is a super-fast parser that produces a\nSpiderMonkey AST.  It has a small CLI utility that parses one file and dumps\nthe AST in JSON on the standard output.  To use UglifyJS to mangle and\ncompress that:\n\n    acorn file.js | uglifyjs --spidermonkey -m -c\n\nThe `--spidermonkey` option tells UglifyJS that all input files are not\nJavaScript, but JS code described in SpiderMonkey AST in JSON.  Therefore we\ndon't use our own parser in this case, but just transform that AST into our\ninternal AST.\n\n### Use Acorn for parsing\n\nMore for fun, I added the `--acorn` option which will use Acorn to do all\nthe parsing.  If you pass this option, UglifyJS will `require(\"acorn\")`.\n\nAcorn is really fast (e.g. 250ms instead of 380ms on some 650K code), but\nconverting the SpiderMonkey tree that Acorn produces takes another 150ms so\nin total it's a bit more than just using UglifyJS's own parser.\n\nAPI Reference\n-------------\n\nAssuming installation via NPM, you can load UglifyJS in your application\nlike this:\n\n    var UglifyJS = require(\"uglify-js\");\n\nIt exports a lot of names, but I'll discuss here the basics that are needed\nfor parsing, mangling and compressing a piece of code.  The sequence is (1)\nparse, (2) compress, (3) mangle, (4) generate output code.\n\n### The simple way\n\nThere's a single toplevel function which combines all the steps.  If you\ndon't need additional customization, you might want to go with `minify`.\nExample:\n\n    var result = UglifyJS.minify(\"/path/to/file.js\");\n    console.log(result.code); // minified output\n    // if you need to pass code instead of file name\n    var result = UglifyJS.minify(\"var b = function () {};\", {fromString: true});\n\nYou can also compress multiple files:\n\n    var result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ]);\n    console.log(result.code);\n\nTo generate a source map:\n\n    var result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ], {\n        outSourceMap: \"out.js.map\"\n    });\n    console.log(result.code); // minified output\n    console.log(result.map);\n\nNote that the source map is not saved in a file, it's just returned in\n`result.map`.  The value passed for `outSourceMap` is only used to set the\n`file` attribute in the source map (see [the spec][sm-spec]).\n\nYou can also specify sourceRoot property to be included in source map:\n\n    var result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ], {\n        outSourceMap: \"out.js.map\",\n        sourceRoot: \"http://example.com/src\"\n    });\n\n\nIf you're compressing compiled JavaScript and have a source map for it, you\ncan use the `inSourceMap` argument:\n\n    var result = UglifyJS.minify(\"compiled.js\", {\n        inSourceMap: \"compiled.js.map\",\n        outSourceMap: \"minified.js.map\"\n    });\n    // same as before, it returns `code` and `map`\n\nThe `inSourceMap` is only used if you also request `outSourceMap` (it makes\nno sense otherwise).\n\nOther options:\n\n- `warnings` (default `false`) — pass `true` to display compressor warnings.\n\n- `fromString` (default `false`) — if you pass `true` then you can pass\n  JavaScript source code, rather than file names.\n\n- `mangle` — pass `false` to skip mangling names.\n\n- `output` (default `null`) — pass an object if you wish to specify\n  additional [output options][codegen].  The defaults are optimized\n  for best compression.\n\n- `compress` (default `{}`) — pass `false` to skip compressing entirely.\n  Pass an object to specify custom [compressor options][compressor].\n\nWe could add more options to `UglifyJS.minify` — if you need additional\nfunctionality please suggest!\n\n### The hard way\n\nFollowing there's more detailed API info, in case the `minify` function is\ntoo simple for your needs.\n\n#### The parser\n\n    var toplevel_ast = UglifyJS.parse(code, options);\n\n`options` is optional and if present it must be an object.  The following\nproperties are available:\n\n- `strict` — disable automatic semicolon insertion and support for trailing\n  comma in arrays and objects\n- `filename` — the name of the file where this code is coming from\n- `toplevel` — a `toplevel` node (as returned by a previous invocation of\n  `parse`)\n\nThe last two options are useful when you'd like to minify multiple files and\nget a single file as the output and a proper source map.  Our CLI tool does\nsomething like this:\n\n    var toplevel = null;\n    files.forEach(function(file){\n        var code = fs.readFileSync(file);\n        toplevel = UglifyJS.parse(code, {\n            filename: file,\n            toplevel: toplevel\n        });\n    });\n\nAfter this, we have in `toplevel` a big AST containing all our files, with\neach token having proper information about where it came from.\n\n#### Scope information\n\nUglifyJS contains a scope analyzer that you need to call manually before\ncompressing or mangling.  Basically it augments various nodes in the AST\nwith information about where is a name defined, how many times is a name\nreferenced, if it is a global or not, if a function is using `eval` or the\n`with` statement etc.  I will discuss this some place else, for now what's\nimportant to know is that you need to call the following before doing\nanything with the tree:\n\n    toplevel.figure_out_scope()\n\n#### Compression\n\nLike this:\n\n    var compressor = UglifyJS.Compressor(options);\n    var compressed_ast = toplevel.transform(compressor);\n\nThe `options` can be missing.  Available options are discussed above in\n“Compressor options”.  Defaults should lead to best compression in most\nscripts.\n\nThe compressor is destructive, so don't rely that `toplevel` remains the\noriginal tree.\n\n#### Mangling\n\nAfter compression it is a good idea to call again `figure_out_scope` (since\nthe compressor might drop unused variables / unreachable code and this might\nchange the number of identifiers or their position).  Optionally, you can\ncall a trick that helps after Gzip (counting character frequency in\nnon-mangleable words).  Example:\n\n    compressed_ast.figure_out_scope();\n    compressed_ast.compute_char_frequency();\n    compressed_ast.mangle_names();\n\n#### Generating output\n\nAST nodes have a `print` method that takes an output stream.  Essentially,\nto generate code you do this:\n\n    var stream = UglifyJS.OutputStream(options);\n    compressed_ast.print(stream);\n    var code = stream.toString(); // this is your minified code\n\nor, for a shortcut you can do:\n\n    var code = compressed_ast.print_to_string(options);\n\nAs usual, `options` is optional.  The output stream accepts a lot of otions,\nmost of them documented above in section “Beautifier options”.  The two\nwhich we care about here are `source_map` and `comments`.\n\n#### Keeping comments in the output\n\nIn order to keep certain comments in the output you need to pass the\n`comments` option.  Pass a RegExp or a function.  If you pass a RegExp, only\nthose comments whose body matches the regexp will be kept.  Note that body\nmeans without the initial `//` or `/*`.  If you pass a function, it will be\ncalled for every comment in the tree and will receive two arguments: the\nnode that the comment is attached to, and the comment token itself.\n\nThe comment token has these properties:\n\n- `type`: \"comment1\" for single-line comments or \"comment2\" for multi-line\n  comments\n- `value`: the comment body\n- `pos` and `endpos`: the start/end positions (zero-based indexes) in the\n  original code where this comment appears\n- `line` and `col`: the line and column where this comment appears in the\n  original code\n- `file` — the file name of the original file\n- `nlb` — true if there was a newline before this comment in the original\n  code, or if this comment contains a newline.\n\nYour function should return `true` to keep the comment, or a falsy value\notherwise.\n\n#### Generating a source mapping\n\nYou need to pass the `source_map` argument when calling `print`.  It needs\nto be a `SourceMap` object (which is a thin wrapper on top of the\n[source-map][source-map] library).\n\nExample:\n\n    var source_map = UglifyJS.SourceMap(source_map_options);\n    var stream = UglifyJS.OutputStream({\n        ...\n        source_map: source_map\n    });\n    compressed_ast.print(stream);\n\n    var code = stream.toString();\n    var map = source_map.toString(); // json output for your source map\n\nThe `source_map_options` (optional) can contain the following properties:\n\n- `file`: the name of the JavaScript output file that this mapping refers to\n- `root`: the `sourceRoot` property (see the [spec][sm-spec])\n- `orig`: the \"original source map\", handy when you compress generated JS\n  and want to map the minified output back to the original code where it\n  came from.  It can be simply a string in JSON, or a JSON object containing\n  the original source map.\n\n  [acorn]: https://github.com/marijnh/acorn\n  [source-map]: https://github.com/mozilla/source-map\n  [sm-spec]: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1RGAehQwRypUTovF1KRlpiOFze0b-_2gc6fAH0KY0k/edit\n  [codegen]: http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/codegen\n  [compressor]: http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/compress\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","_id":"uglify-js@2.3.0","dist":{"shasum":"2cdec16d378a8a2b6ecfb6989784cf8b7ae5491f","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/uglify-js/-/uglify-js-2.3.0.tgz"},"_from":".","_npmVersion":"1.2.18","_npmUser":{"name":"mishoo","email":"mihai.bazon@gmail.com"},"directories":{}},"2.3.1":{"name":"uglify-js","description":"JavaScript parser, mangler/compressor and beautifier toolkit","homepage":"http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs","main":"tools/node.js","version":"2.3.1","engines":{"node":">=0.4.0"},"maintainers":[{"name":"caires","email":"cairesvs@gmail.com"},{"name":"mape","email":"mape@mape.me"},{"name":"mishoo","email":"mihai.bazon@gmail.com"}],"repositories":[{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2.git"}],"dependencies":{"async":"~0.2.6","source-map":"~0.1.7","optimist":"~0.3.5"},"bin":{"uglifyjs":"bin/uglifyjs"},"scripts":{"test":"node test/run-tests.js"},"readme":"UglifyJS 2\n==========\n\nUglifyJS is a JavaScript parser, minifier, compressor or beautifier toolkit.\n\nThis page documents the command line utility.

It's recommended that you pass the\ninput files first, then pass the options.  UglifyJS will parse input files\nin sequence and apply any compression options.  The files are parsed in the\nsame global scope, that is, a reference from a file to some\nvariable/function declared in another file will be matched properly.\n\nIf you want to read from STDIN instead, pass a single dash instead of input\nfiles.\n\nThe available options are:\n\n    --source-map       Specify an output file where to generate source map.\n                                                                          [string]\n    --source-map-root  The path to the original source to be included in the\n                       source map.                                        [string]\n    --source-map-url   The path to the source map to be added in //@\n                       sourceMappingURL.

[string]\n    --in-source-map    Input source map, useful if you're compressing JS that was\n                       generated from some other original code.\n    --screw-ie8        Pass this flag if you don't care about full compliance with\n                       Internet Explorer 6-8 quirks (by default UglifyJS will try\n                       to be IE-proof).\n    -p, --prefix       Skip prefix for original filenames that appear in source\n                       maps. For example -p 3 will drop 3 directories from file\n                       names and ensure they are relative paths.\n    -o, --output       Output file (default STDOUT).\n    -b, --beautify     Beautify output/specify output options.

Pass options\n                       like -c hoist_vars=false,if_return=false. Use -c with no\n                       argument to use the default compression options.   [string]\n    -d, --define       Global definitions                                 [string]\n    --comments         Preserve copyright comments in the output. By default this\n                       works like Google Closure, keeping JSDoc-style comments\n                       that contain \"@license\" or \"@preserve\". You can optionally\n                       pass one of the following arguments to this flag:\n                       - \"all\" to keep all comments\n                       - a valid JS regexp (needs to start with a slash) to keep\n                       only comments that match.\n                       Note that currently not *all* comments can be kept when\n                       compression is on, because of dead code removal or\n                       cascading statements into sequences.

You need to pass an\n                       argument to this option to specify the name that your\n                       module will take when included in, say, a browser.\n                                                                          [string]\n    --export-all       Only used when --wrap, this tells UglifyJS to add code to\n                       automatically export all globals.                 [boolean]\n    --lint             Display some scope warnings                       [boolean]\n    -v, --verbose      Verbose                                           [boolean]\n    -V, --version      Print version number and exit.                    [boolean]\n\nSpecify `--output` (`-o`) to declare the output file.  Otherwise the output\ngoes to STDOUT.\n\n## Source map options\n\nUglifyJS2 can generate a source map file, which is highly useful for\ndebugging your compressed JavaScript.  To get a source map, pass\n`--source-map output.js.map` (full path to the file where you want the\nsource map dumped).\n\nAdditionally you might need `--source-map-root` to pass the URL where the\noriginal files can be found.  In case you are passing full paths to input\nfiles to UglifyJS, you can use `--prefix` (`-p`) to specify the number of\ndirectories to drop from the path prefix when declaring files in the source\nmap.\n\nFor example:\n\n    uglifyjs /home/doe/work/foo/src/js/file1.js \\\n             /home/doe/work/foo/src/js/file2.js \\\n             -o foo.min.js \\\n             --source-map foo.min.js.map \\\n             --source-map-root http://foo.com/src \\\n             -p 5 -c -m\n\nThe above will compress and mangle `file1.js` and `file2.js`, will drop the\noutput in `foo.min.js` and the source map in `foo.min.js.map`.  The source\nmapping will refer to `http://foo.com/src/js/file1.js` and\n`http://foo.com/src/js/file2.js` (in fact it will list `http://foo.com/src`\nas the source map root, and the original files as `js/file1.js` and\n`js/file2.js`).\n\n### Composed source map\n\nWhen you're compressing JS code that was output by a compiler such as\nCoffeeScript, mapping to the JS code won't be too helpful.  Instead, you'd\nlike to map back to the original code (i.e. CoffeeScript).  UglifyJS has an\noption to take an input source map.  Assuming you have a mapping from\nCoffeeScript → compiled JS, UglifyJS can generate a map from CoffeeScript →\ncompressed JS by mapping every token in the compiled JS to its original\nlocation.\n\nTo use this feature you need to pass `--in-source-map\n/path/to/input/source.map`.  Normally the input source map should also point\nto the file containing the generated JS, so if that's correct you can omit\ninput files from the command line.\n\n## Mangler options\n\nTo enable the mangler you need to pass `--mangle` (`-m`).  The following\n(comma-separated) options are supported:\n\n- `sort` — to assign shorter names to most frequently used variables.  This\n  saves a few hundred bytes on jQuery before gzip, but the output is\n  _bigger_ after gzip (and seems to happen for other libraries I tried it\n  on) therefore it's not enabled by default.\n\n- `toplevel` — mangle names declared in the toplevel scope (disabled by\n  default).\n\n- `eval` — mangle names visible in scopes where `eval` or `when` are used\n  (disabled by default).\n\nWhen mangling is enabled but you want to prevent certain names from being\nmangled, you can declare those names with `--reserved` (`-r`) — pass a\ncomma-separated list of names.  For example:\n\n    uglifyjs ... -m -r '$,require,exports'\n\nto prevent the `require`, `exports` and `$` names from being changed.\n\n## Compressor options\n\nYou need to pass `--compress` (`-c`) to enable the compressor.  Optionally\nyou can pass a comma-separated list of options.  Options are in the form\n`foo=bar`, or just `foo` (the latter implies a boolean option that you want\nto set `true`; it's effectively a shortcut for `foo=true`).\n\n- `sequences` -- join consecutive simple statements using the comma operator\n- `properties` -- rewrite property access using the dot notation, for\n  example `foo[\"bar\"] → foo.bar`\n- `dead_code` -- remove unreachable code\n- `drop_debugger` -- remove `debugger;` statements\n- `unsafe` (default: false) -- apply \"unsafe\" transformations (discussion below)\n- `conditionals` -- apply optimizations for `if`-s and conditional\n  expressions\n- `comparisons` -- apply certain optimizations to binary nodes, for example:\n  `!(a <= b) → a > b` (only when `unsafe`), attempts to negate binary nodes,\n  e.g. `a = !b && !c && !d && !e → a=!(b||c||d||e)` etc.\n- `evaluate` -- attempt to evaluate constant expressions\n- `booleans` -- various optimizations for boolean context, for example `!!a\n  ? b : c → a ? b : c`\n- `loops` -- optimizations for `do`, `while` and `for` loops when we can\n  statically determine the condition\n- `unused` -- drop unreferenced functions and variables\n- `hoist_funs` -- hoist function declarations\n- `hoist_vars` (default: false) -- hoist `var` declarations (this is `false`\n  by default because it seems to increase the size of the output in general)\n- `if_return` -- optimizations for if/return and if/continue\n- `join_vars` -- join consecutive `var` statements\n- `cascade` -- small optimization for sequences, transform `x, x` into `x`\n  and `x = something(), x` into `x = something()`\n- `warnings` -- display warnings when dropping unreachable code or unused\n  declarations etc.\n\n### The `unsafe` option\n\nIt enables some transformations that *might* break code logic in certain\ncontrived cases, but should be fine for most code.  You might want to try it\non your own code, it should reduce the minified size.  Here's what happens\nwhen this flag is on:\n\n- `new Array(1, 2, 3)` or `Array(1, 2, 3)` → `[1, 2, 3 ]`\n- `new Object()` → `{}`\n- `String(exp)` or `exp.toString()` → `\"\" + exp`\n- `new Object/RegExp/Function/Error/Array (...)` → we discard the `new`\n- `typeof foo == \"undefined\"` → `foo === void 0`\n- `void 0` → `\"undefined\"` (if there is a variable named \"undefined\" in\n  scope; we do it because the variable name will be mangled, typically\n  reduced to a single character).\n\n### Conditional compilation\n\nYou can use the `--define` (`-d`) switch in order to declare global\nvariables that UglifyJS will assume to be constants (unless defined in\nscope).  For example if you pass `--define DEBUG=false` then, coupled with\ndead code removal UglifyJS will discard the following from the output:\n```javascript\nif (DEBUG) {\n\tconsole.log(\"debug stuff\");\n}\n```\n\nUglifyJS will warn about the condition being always false and about dropping\nunreachable code; for now there is no option to turn off only this specific\nwarning, you can pass `warnings=false` to turn off *all* warnings.\n\nAnother way of doing that is to declare your globals as constants in a\nseparate file and include it into the build.  For example you can have a\n`build/defines.js` file with the following:\n```javascript\nconst DEBUG = false;\nconst PRODUCTION = true;\n// etc.\n```\n\nand build your code like this:\n\n    uglifyjs build/defines.js js/foo.js js/bar.js... -c\n\nUglifyJS will notice the constants and, since they cannot be altered, it\nwill evaluate references to them to the value itself and drop unreachable\ncode as usual.  The possible downside of this approach is that the build\nwill contain the `const` declarations.\n\n<a name=\"codegen-options\"></a>\n## Beautifier options\n\nThe code generator tries to output shortest code possible by default.  In\ncase you want beautified output, pass `--beautify` (`-b`).  Optionally you\ncan pass additional arguments that control the code output:\n\n- `beautify` (default `true`) -- whether to actually beautify the output.\n  Passing `-b` will set this to true, but you might need to pass `-b` even\n  when you want to generate minified code, in order to specify additional\n  arguments, so you can use `-b beautify=false` to override it.\n- `indent-level` (default 4)\n- `indent-start` (default 0) -- prefix all lines by that many spaces\n- `quote-keys` (default `false`) -- pass `true` to quote all keys in literal\n  objects\n- `space-colon` (default `true`) -- insert a space after the colon signs\n- `ascii-only` (default `false`) -- escape Unicode characters in strings and\n  regexps\n- `inline-script` (default `false`) -- escape the slash in occurrences of\n  `</script` in strings\n- `width` (default 80) -- only takes effect when beautification is on, this\n  specifies an (orientative) line width that the beautifier will try to\n  obey.  It refers to the width of the line text (excluding indentation).\n  It doesn't work very well currently, but it does make the code generated\n  by UglifyJS more readable.\n- `max-line-len` (default 32000) -- maximum line length (for uglified code)\n- `ie-proof` (default `true`) -- generate “IE-proof” code (for now this\n  means add brackets around the do/while in code like this: `if (foo) do\n  something(); while (bar); else ...`.\n- `bracketize` (default `false`) -- always insert brackets in `if`, `for`,\n  `do`, `while` or `with` statements, even if their body is a single\n  statement.\n- `semicolons` (default `true`) -- separate statements with semicolons.  If\n  you pass `false` then whenever possible we will use a newline instead of a\n  semicolon, leading to more readable output of uglified code (size before\n  gzip could be smaller; size after gzip insignificantly larger).\n\n### Keeping copyright notices or other comments\n\nYou can pass `--comments` to retain certain comments in the output.  By\ndefault it will keep JSDoc-style comments that contain \"@preserve\",\n\"@license\" or \"@cc_on\" (conditional compilation for IE).  You can pass\n`--comments all` to keep all the comments, or a valid JavaScript regexp to\nkeep only comments that match this regexp.  For example `--comments\n'/foo|bar/'` will keep only comments that contain \"foo\" or \"bar\".\n\nNote, however, that there might be situations where comments are lost.  For\nexample:\n```javascript\nfunction f() {\n\t/** @preserve Foo Bar */\n\tfunction g() {\n\t  // this function is never called\n\t}\n\treturn something();\n}\n```\n\nEven though it has \"@preserve\", the comment will be lost because the inner\nfunction `g` (which is the AST node to which the comment is attached to) is\ndiscarded by the compressor as not referenced.\n\nThe safest comments where to place copyright information (or other info that\nneeds to be kept in the output) are comments attached to toplevel nodes.\n\n## Support for the SpiderMonkey AST\n\nUglifyJS2 has its own abstract syntax tree format; for\n[practical reasons](http://lisperator.net/blog/uglifyjs-why-not-switching-to-spidermonkey-ast/)\nwe can't easily change to using the SpiderMonkey AST internally.  However,\nUglifyJS now has a converter which can import a SpiderMonkey AST.\n\nFor example [Acorn][acorn] is a super-fast parser that produces a\nSpiderMonkey AST.  It has a small CLI utility that parses one file and dumps\nthe AST in JSON on the standard output.  To use UglifyJS to mangle and\ncompress that:\n\n    acorn file.js | uglifyjs --spidermonkey -m -c\n\nThe `--spidermonkey` option tells UglifyJS that all input files are not\nJavaScript, but JS code described in SpiderMonkey AST in JSON.  Therefore we\ndon't use our own parser in this case, but just transform that AST into our\ninternal AST.\n\n### Use Acorn for parsing\n\nMore for fun, I added the `--acorn` option which will use Acorn to do all\nthe parsing.  If you pass this option, UglifyJS will `require(\"acorn\")`.\n\nAcorn is really fast (e.g. 250ms instead of 380ms on some 650K code), but\nconverting the SpiderMonkey tree that Acorn produces takes another 150ms so\nin total it's a bit more than just using UglifyJS's own parser.\n\nAPI Reference\n-------------\n\nAssuming installation via NPM, you can load UglifyJS in your application\nlike this:\n```javascript\nvar UglifyJS = require(\"uglify-js\");\n```\n\nIt exports a lot of names, but I'll discuss here the basics that are needed\nfor parsing, mangling and compressing a piece of code.  The sequence is (1)\nparse, (2) compress, (3) mangle, (4) generate output code.\n\n### The simple way\n\nThere's a single toplevel function which combines all the steps.  If you\ndon't need additional customization, you might want to go with `minify`.\nExample:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify(\"/path/to/file.js\");\nconsole.log(result.code); // minified output\n// if you need to pass code instead of file name\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify(\"var b = function () {};\", {fromString: true});\n```\n\nYou can also compress multiple files:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ]);\nconsole.log(result.code);\n```\n\nTo generate a source map:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ], {\n\toutSourceMap: \"out.js.map\"\n});\nconsole.log(result.code); // minified output\nconsole.log(result.map);\n```\n\nNote that the source map is not saved in a file, it's just returned in\n`result.map`.  The value passed for `outSourceMap` is only used to set the\n`file` attribute in the source map (see [the spec][sm-spec]).\n\nYou can also specify sourceRoot property to be included in source map:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ], {\n\toutSourceMap: \"out.js.map\",\n\tsourceRoot: \"http://example.com/src\"\n});\n```\n\nIf you're compressing compiled JavaScript and have a source map for it, you\ncan use the `inSourceMap` argument:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify(\"compiled.js\", {\n\tinSourceMap: \"compiled.js.map\",\n\toutSourceMap: \"minified.js.map\"\n});\n// same as before, it returns `code` and `map`\n```\n\nThe `inSourceMap` is only used if you also request `outSourceMap` (it makes\nno sense otherwise).\n\nOther options:\n\n- `warnings` (default `false`) — pass `true` to display compressor warnings.\n\n- `fromString` (default `false`) — if you pass `true` then you can pass\n  JavaScript source code, rather than file names.\n\n- `mangle` — pass `false` to skip mangling names.\n\n- `output` (default `null`) — pass an object if you wish to specify\n  additional [output options][codegen].  The defaults are optimized\n  for best compression.\n\n- `compress` (default `{}`) — pass `false` to skip compressing entirely.\n  Pass an object to specify custom [compressor options][compressor].\n\nWe could add more options to `UglifyJS.minify` — if you need additional\nfunctionality please suggest!\n\n### The hard way\n\nFollowing there's more detailed API info, in case the `minify` function is\ntoo simple for your needs.\n\n#### The parser\n```javascript\nvar toplevel_ast = UglifyJS.parse(code, options);\n```\n\n`options` is optional and if present it must be an object.  The following\nproperties are available:\n\n- `strict` — disable automatic semicolon insertion and support for trailing\n  comma in arrays and objects\n- `filename` — the name of the file where this code is coming from\n- `toplevel` — a `toplevel` node (as returned by a previous invocation of\n  `parse`)\n\nThe last two options are useful when you'd like to minify multiple files and\nget a single file as the output and a proper source map.  Our CLI tool does\nsomething like this:\n```javascript\nvar toplevel = null;\nfiles.forEach(function(file){\n\tvar code = fs.readFileSync(file);\n\ttoplevel = UglifyJS.parse(code, {\n\t\tfilename: file,\n\t\ttoplevel: toplevel\n\t});\n});\n```\n\nAfter this, we have in `toplevel` a big AST containing all our files, with\neach token having proper information about where it came from.\n\n#### Scope information\n\nUglifyJS contains a scope analyzer that you need to call manually before\ncompressing or mangling.  Basically it augments various nodes in the AST\nwith information about where is a name defined, how many times is a name\nreferenced, if it is a global or not, if a function is using `eval` or the\n`with` statement etc.  I will discuss this some place else, for now what's\nimportant to know is that you need to call the following before doing\nanything with the tree:\n```javascript\ntoplevel.figure_out_scope()\n```\n\n#### Compression\n\nLike this:\n```javascript\nvar compressor = UglifyJS.Compressor(options);\nvar compressed_ast = toplevel.transform(compressor);\n```\n\nThe `options` can be missing.  Available options are discussed above in\n“Compressor options”.  Defaults should lead to best compression in most\nscripts.\n\nThe compressor is destructive, so don't rely that `toplevel` remains the\noriginal tree.\n\n#### Mangling\n\nAfter compression it is a good idea to call again `figure_out_scope` (since\nthe compressor might drop unused variables / unreachable code and this might\nchange the number of identifiers or their position).  Optionally, you can\ncall a trick that helps after Gzip (counting character frequency in\nnon-mangleable words).  Example:\n```javascript\ncompressed_ast.figure_out_scope();\ncompressed_ast.compute_char_frequency();\ncompressed_ast.mangle_names();\n```\n\n#### Generating output\n\nAST nodes have a `print` method that takes an output stream.  Essentially,\nto generate code you do this:\n```javascript\nvar stream = UglifyJS.OutputStream(options);\ncompressed_ast.print(stream);\nvar code = stream.toString(); // this is your minified code\n```\n\nor, for a shortcut you can do:\n```javascript\nvar code = compressed_ast.print_to_string(options);\n```\n\nAs usual, `options` is optional.  The output stream accepts a lot of otions,\nmost of them documented above in section “Beautifier options”.  The two\nwhich we care about here are `source_map` and `comments`.\n\n#### Keeping comments in the output\n\nIn order to keep certain comments in the output you need to pass the\n`comments` option.  Pass a RegExp or a function.  If you pass a RegExp, only\nthose comments whose body matches the regexp will be kept.  Note that body\nmeans without the initial `//` or `/*`.  If you pass a function, it will be\ncalled for every comment in the tree and will receive two arguments: the\nnode that the comment is attached to, and the comment token itself.\n\nThe comment token has these properties:\n\n- `type`: \"comment1\" for single-line comments or \"comment2\" for multi-line\n  comments\n- `value`: the comment body\n- `pos` and `endpos`: the start/end positions (zero-based indexes) in the\n  original code where this comment appears\n- `line` and `col`: the line and column where this comment appears in the\n  original code\n- `file` — the file name of the original file\n- `nlb` — true if there was a newline before this comment in the original\n  code, or if this comment contains a newline.\n\nYour function should return `true` to keep the comment, or a falsy value\notherwise.\n\n#### Generating a source mapping\n\nYou need to pass the `source_map` argument when calling `print`.  It needs\nto be a `SourceMap` object (which is a thin wrapper on top of the\n[source-map][source-map] library).\n\nExample:\n```javascript\nvar source_map = UglifyJS.SourceMap(source_map_options);\nvar stream = UglifyJS.OutputStream({\n\t...\n\tsource_map: source_map\n});\ncompressed_ast.print(stream);\n\nvar code = stream.toString();\nvar map = source_map.toString(); // json output for your source map\n```\n\nThe `source_map_options` (optional) can contain the following properties:\n\n- `file`: the name of the JavaScript output file that this mapping refers to\n- `root`: the `sourceRoot` property (see the [spec][sm-spec])\n- `orig`: the \"original source map\", handy when you compress generated JS\n  and want to map the minified output back to the original code where it\n  came from.  It can be simply a string in JSON, or a JSON object containing\n  the original source map.\n\n  [acorn]: https://github.com/marijnh/acorn\n  [source-map]: https://github.com/mozilla/source-map\n  [sm-spec]: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1RGAehQwRypUTovF1KRlpiOFze0b-_2gc6fAH0KY0k/edit\n  [codegen]: http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/codegen\n  [compressor]: http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/compress\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","_id":"uglify-js@2.3.1","dist":{"shasum":"78ce618c52e27aac408298f80f910f56c80cc884","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/uglify-js/-/uglify-js-2.3.1.tgz"},"_from":".","_npmVersion":"1.2.18","_npmUser":{"name":"mishoo","email":"mihai.bazon@gmail.com"},"directories":{}},"2.3.2":{"name":"uglify-js","description":"JavaScript parser, mangler/compressor and beautifier toolkit","homepage":"http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs","main":"tools/node.js","version":"2.3.2","engines":{"node":">=0.4.0"},"maintainers":[{"name":"caires","email":"cairesvs@gmail.com"},{"name":"mape","email":"mape@mape.me"},{"name":"mishoo","email":"mihai.bazon@gmail.com"}],"repositories":[{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2.git"}],"dependencies":{"async":"~0.2.6","source-map":"~0.1.7","optimist":"~0.3.5"},"bin":{"uglifyjs":"bin/uglifyjs"},"scripts":{"test":"node test/run-tests.js"},"readme":"UglifyJS 2\n==========\n\nUglifyJS is a JavaScript parser, minifier, compressor or beautifier toolkit.\n\nThis page documents the command line utility.  For\n[API and internals documentation see my website](http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/).\nThere's also an\n[in-browser online demo](http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/#demo) (for Firefox,\nChrome and probably Safari).\n\nInstall\n-------\n\nFirst make sure you have installed the latest version of [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)\n(You may need to restart your computer after this step).\n\nFrom NPM for use as a command line app:\n\n    npm install uglify-js -g\n\nFrom NPM for programmatic use:\n\n    npm install uglify-js\n\nFrom Git:\n\n    git clone git://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2.git\n    cd UglifyJS2\n    npm link .\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n    uglifyjs [input files] [options]\n\nUglifyJS2 can take multiple input files.  It's recommended that you pass the\ninput files first, then pass the options.  UglifyJS will parse input files\nin sequence and apply any compression options.  The files are parsed in the\nsame global scope, that is, a reference from a file to some\nvariable/function declared in another file will be matched properly.\n\nIf you want to read from STDIN instead, pass a single dash instead of input\nfiles.\n\nThe available options are:\n\n    --source-map       Specify an output file where to generate source map.\n                                                                          [string]\n    --source-map-root  The path to the original source to be included in the\n                       source map.                                        [string]\n    --source-map-url   The path to the source map to be added in //@\n                       sourceMappingURL.  Defaults to the value passed with\n                       --source-map.                                      [string]\n    --in-source-map    Input source map, useful if you're compressing JS that was\n                       generated from some other original code.\n    --screw-ie8        Pass this flag if you don't care about full compliance with\n                       Internet Explorer 6-8 quirks (by default UglifyJS will try\n                       to be IE-proof).\n    -p, --prefix       Skip prefix for original filenames that appear in source\n                       maps. For example -p 3 will drop 3 directories from file\n                       names and ensure they are relative paths.\n    -o, --output       Output file (default STDOUT).\n    -b, --beautify     Beautify output/specify output options.            [string]\n    -m, --mangle       Mangle names/pass mangler options.                 [string]\n    -r, --reserved     Reserved names to exclude from mangling.\n    -c, --compress     Enable compressor/pass compressor options. Pass options\n                       like -c hoist_vars=false,if_return=false. Use -c with no\n                       argument to use the default compression options.   [string]\n    -d, --define       Global definitions                                 [string]\n    --comments         Preserve copyright comments in the output. By default this\n                       works like Google Closure, keeping JSDoc-style comments\n                       that contain \"@license\" or \"@preserve\". You can optionally\n                       pass one of the following arguments to this flag:\n                       - \"all\" to keep all comments\n                       - a valid JS regexp (needs to start with a slash) to keep\n                       only comments that match.\n                       Note that currently not *all* comments can be kept when\n                       compression is on, because of dead code removal or\n                       cascading statements into sequences.               [string]\n    --stats            Display operations run time on STDERR.            [boolean]\n    --acorn            Use Acorn for parsing.                            [boolean]\n    --spidermonkey     Assume input files are SpiderMonkey AST format (as JSON).\n                                                                         [boolean]\n    --self             Build itself (UglifyJS2) as a library (implies\n                       --wrap=UglifyJS --export-all)                     [boolean]\n    --wrap             Embed everything in a big function, making the “exports”\n                       and “global” variables available. You need to pass an\n                       argument to this option to specify the name that your\n                       module will take when included in, say, a browser.\n                                                                          [string]\n    --export-all       Only used when --wrap, this tells UglifyJS to add code to\n                       automatically export all globals.                 [boolean]\n    --lint             Display some scope warnings                       [boolean]\n    -v, --verbose      Verbose                                           [boolean]\n    -V, --version      Print version number and exit.                    [boolean]\n\nSpecify `--output` (`-o`) to declare the output file.  Otherwise the output\ngoes to STDOUT.\n\n## Source map options\n\nUglifyJS2 can generate a source map file, which is highly useful for\ndebugging your compressed JavaScript.  To get a source map, pass\n`--source-map output.js.map` (full path to the file where you want the\nsource map dumped).\n\nAdditionally you might need `--source-map-root` to pass the URL where the\noriginal files can be found.  In case you are passing full paths to input\nfiles to UglifyJS, you can use `--prefix` (`-p`) to specify the number of\ndirectories to drop from the path prefix when declaring files in the source\nmap.\n\nFor example:\n\n    uglifyjs /home/doe/work/foo/src/js/file1.js \\\n             /home/doe/work/foo/src/js/file2.js \\\n             -o foo.min.js \\\n             --source-map foo.min.js.map \\\n             --source-map-root http://foo.com/src \\\n             -p 5 -c -m\n\nThe above will compress and mangle `file1.js` and `file2.js`, will drop the\noutput in `foo.min.js` and the source map in `foo.min.js.map`.  The source\nmapping will refer to `http://foo.com/src/js/file1.js` and\n`http://foo.com/src/js/file2.js` (in fact it will list `http://foo.com/src`\nas the source map root, and the original files as `js/file1.js` and\n`js/file2.js`).\n\n### Composed source map\n\nWhen you're compressing JS code that was output by a compiler such as\nCoffeeScript, mapping to the JS code won't be too helpful.  Instead, you'd\nlike to map back to the original code (i.e. CoffeeScript).  UglifyJS has an\noption to take an input source map.  Assuming you have a mapping from\nCoffeeScript → compiled JS, UglifyJS can generate a map from CoffeeScript →\ncompressed JS by mapping every token in the compiled JS to its original\nlocation.\n\nTo use this feature you need to pass `--in-source-map\n/path/to/input/source.map`.  Normally the input source map should also point\nto the file containing the generated JS, so if that's correct you can omit\ninput files from the command line.\n\n## Mangler options\n\nTo enable the mangler you need to pass `--mangle` (`-m`).  The following\n(comma-separated) options are supported:\n\n- `sort` — to assign shorter names to most frequently used variables.  This\n  saves a few hundred bytes on jQuery before gzip, but the output is\n  _bigger_ after gzip (and seems to happen for other libraries I tried it\n  on) therefore it's not enabled by default.\n\n- `toplevel` — mangle names declared in the toplevel scope (disabled by\n  default).\n\n- `eval` — mangle names visible in scopes where `eval` or `when` are used\n  (disabled by default).\n\nWhen mangling is enabled but you want to prevent certain names from being\nmangled, you can declare those names with `--reserved` (`-r`) — pass a\ncomma-separated list of names.  For example:\n\n    uglifyjs ... -m -r '$,require,exports'\n\nto prevent the `require`, `exports` and `$` names from being changed.\n\n## Compressor options\n\nYou need to pass `--compress` (`-c`) to enable the compressor.  Optionally\nyou can pass a comma-separated list of options.  Options are in the form\n`foo=bar`, or just `foo` (the latter implies a boolean option that you want\nto set `true`; it's effectively a shortcut for `foo=true`).\n\n- `sequences` -- join consecutive simple statements using the comma operator\n- `properties` -- rewrite property access using the dot notation, for\n  example `foo[\"bar\"] → foo.bar`\n- `dead_code` -- remove unreachable code\n- `drop_debugger` -- remove `debugger;` statements\n- `unsafe` (default: false) -- apply \"unsafe\" transformations (discussion below)\n- `conditionals` -- apply optimizations for `if`-s and conditional\n  expressions\n- `comparisons` -- apply certain optimizations to binary nodes, for example:\n  `!(a <= b) → a > b` (only when `unsafe`), attempts to negate binary nodes,\n  e.g. `a = !b && !c && !d && !e → a=!(b||c||d||e)` etc.\n- `evaluate` -- attempt to evaluate constant expressions\n- `booleans` -- various optimizations for boolean context, for example `!!a\n  ? b : c → a ? b : c`\n- `loops` -- optimizations for `do`, `while` and `for` loops when we can\n  statically determine the condition\n- `unused` -- drop unreferenced functions and variables\n- `hoist_funs` -- hoist function declarations\n- `hoist_vars` (default: false) -- hoist `var` declarations (this is `false`\n  by default because it seems to increase the size of the output in general)\n- `if_return` -- optimizations for if/return and if/continue\n- `join_vars` -- join consecutive `var` statements\n- `cascade` -- small optimization for sequences, transform `x, x` into `x`\n  and `x = something(), x` into `x = something()`\n- `warnings` -- display warnings when dropping unreachable code or unused\n  declarations etc.\n\n### The `unsafe` option\n\nIt enables some transformations that *might* break code logic in certain\ncontrived cases, but should be fine for most code.  You might want to try it\non your own code, it should reduce the minified size.  Here's what happens\nwhen this flag is on:\n\n- `new Array(1, 2, 3)` or `Array(1, 2, 3)` → `[1, 2, 3 ]`\n- `new Object()` → `{}`\n- `String(exp)` or `exp.toString()` → `\"\" + exp`\n- `new Object/RegExp/Function/Error/Array (...)` → we discard the `new`\n- `typeof foo == \"undefined\"` → `foo === void 0`\n- `void 0` → `\"undefined\"` (if there is a variable named \"undefined\" in\n  scope; we do it because the variable name will be mangled, typically\n  reduced to a single character).\n\n### Conditional compilation\n\nYou can use the `--define` (`-d`) switch in order to declare global\nvariables that UglifyJS will assume to be constants (unless defined in\nscope).  For example if you pass `--define DEBUG=false` then, coupled with\ndead code removal UglifyJS will discard the following from the output:\n```javascript\nif (DEBUG) {\n\tconsole.log(\"debug stuff\");\n}\n```\n\nUglifyJS will warn about the condition being always false and about dropping\nunreachable code; for now there is no option to turn off only this specific\nwarning, you can pass `warnings=false` to turn off *all* warnings.\n\nAnother way of doing that is to declare your globals as constants in a\nseparate file and include it into the build.  For example you can have a\n`build/defines.js` file with the following:\n```javascript\nconst DEBUG = false;\nconst PRODUCTION = true;\n// etc.\n```\n\nand build your code like this:\n\n    uglifyjs build/defines.js js/foo.js js/bar.js... -c\n\nUglifyJS will notice the constants and, since they cannot be altered, it\nwill evaluate references to them to the value itself and drop unreachable\ncode as usual.  The possible downside of this approach is that the build\nwill contain the `const` declarations.\n\n<a name=\"codegen-options\"></a>\n## Beautifier options\n\nThe code generator tries to output shortest code possible by default.  In\ncase you want beautified output, pass `--beautify` (`-b`).  Optionally you\ncan pass additional arguments that control the code output:\n\n- `beautify` (default `true`) -- whether to actually beautify the output.\n  Passing `-b` will set this to true, but you might need to pass `-b` even\n  when you want to generate minified code, in order to specify additional\n  arguments, so you can use `-b beautify=false` to override it.\n- `indent-level` (default 4)\n- `indent-start` (default 0) -- prefix all lines by that many spaces\n- `quote-keys` (default `false`) -- pass `true` to quote all keys in literal\n  objects\n- `space-colon` (default `true`) -- insert a space after the colon signs\n- `ascii-only` (default `false`) -- escape Unicode characters in strings and\n  regexps\n- `inline-script` (default `false`) -- escape the slash in occurrences of\n  `</script` in strings\n- `width` (default 80) -- only takes effect when beautification is on, this\n  specifies an (orientative) line width that the beautifier will try to\n  obey.  It refers to the width of the line text (excluding indentation).\n  It doesn't work very well currently, but it does make the code generated\n  by UglifyJS more readable.\n- `max-line-len` (default 32000) -- maximum line length (for uglified code)\n- `ie-proof` (default `true`) -- generate “IE-proof” code (for now this\n  means add brackets around the do/while in code like this: `if (foo) do\n  something(); while (bar); else ...`.\n- `bracketize` (default `false`) -- always insert brackets in `if`, `for`,\n  `do`, `while` or `with` statements, even if their body is a single\n  statement.\n- `semicolons` (default `true`) -- separate statements with semicolons.  If\n  you pass `false` then whenever possible we will use a newline instead of a\n  semicolon, leading to more readable output of uglified code (size before\n  gzip could be smaller; size after gzip insignificantly larger).\n\n### Keeping copyright notices or other comments\n\nYou can pass `--comments` to retain certain comments in the output.  By\ndefault it will keep JSDoc-style comments that contain \"@preserve\",\n\"@license\" or \"@cc_on\" (conditional compilation for IE).  You can pass\n`--comments all` to keep all the comments, or a valid JavaScript regexp to\nkeep only comments that match this regexp.  For example `--comments\n'/foo|bar/'` will keep only comments that contain \"foo\" or \"bar\".\n\nNote, however, that there might be situations where comments are lost.  For\nexample:\n```javascript\nfunction f() {\n\t/** @preserve Foo Bar */\n\tfunction g() {\n\t  // this function is never called\n\t}\n\treturn something();\n}\n```\n\nEven though it has \"@preserve\", the comment will be lost because the inner\nfunction `g` (which is the AST node to which the comment is attached to) is\ndiscarded by the compressor as not referenced.\n\nThe safest comments where to place copyright information (or other info that\nneeds to be kept in the output) are comments attached to toplevel nodes.\n\n## Support for the SpiderMonkey AST\n\nUglifyJS2 has its own abstract syntax tree format; for\n[practical reasons](http://lisperator.net/blog/uglifyjs-why-not-switching-to-spidermonkey-ast/)\nwe can't easily change to using the SpiderMonkey AST internally.  However,\nUglifyJS now has a converter which can import a SpiderMonkey AST.\n\nFor example [Acorn][acorn] is a super-fast parser that produces a\nSpiderMonkey AST.  It has a small CLI utility that parses one file and dumps\nthe AST in JSON on the standard output.  To use UglifyJS to mangle and\ncompress that:\n\n    acorn file.js | uglifyjs --spidermonkey -m -c\n\nThe `--spidermonkey` option tells UglifyJS that all input files are not\nJavaScript, but JS code described in SpiderMonkey AST in JSON.  Therefore we\ndon't use our own parser in this case, but just transform that AST into our\ninternal AST.\n\n### Use Acorn for parsing\n\nMore for fun, I added the `--acorn` option which will use Acorn to do all\nthe parsing.  If you pass this option, UglifyJS will `require(\"acorn\")`.\n\nAcorn is really fast (e.g. 250ms instead of 380ms on some 650K code), but\nconverting the SpiderMonkey tree that Acorn produces takes another 150ms so\nin total it's a bit more than just using UglifyJS's own parser.\n\nAPI Reference\n-------------\n\nAssuming installation via NPM, you can load UglifyJS in your application\nlike this:\n```javascript\nvar UglifyJS = require(\"uglify-js\");\n```\n\nIt exports a lot of names, but I'll discuss here the basics that are needed\nfor parsing, mangling and compressing a piece of code.  The sequence is (1)\nparse, (2) compress, (3) mangle, (4) generate output code.\n\n### The simple way\n\nThere's a single toplevel function which combines all the steps.  If you\ndon't need additional customization, you might want to go with `minify`.\nExample:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify(\"/path/to/file.js\");\nconsole.log(result.code); // minified output\n// if you need to pass code instead of file name\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify(\"var b = function () {};\", {fromString: true});\n```\n\nYou can also compress multiple files:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ]);\nconsole.log(result.code);\n```\n\nTo generate a source map:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ], {\n\toutSourceMap: \"out.js.map\"\n});\nconsole.log(result.code); // minified output\nconsole.log(result.map);\n```\n\nNote that the source map is not saved in a file, it's just returned in\n`result.map`.  The value passed for `outSourceMap` is only used to set the\n`file` attribute in the source map (see [the spec][sm-spec]).\n\nYou can also specify sourceRoot property to be included in source map:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ], {\n\toutSourceMap: \"out.js.map\",\n\tsourceRoot: \"http://example.com/src\"\n});\n```\n\nIf you're compressing compiled JavaScript and have a source map for it, you\ncan use the `inSourceMap` argument:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify(\"compiled.js\", {\n\tinSourceMap: \"compiled.js.map\",\n\toutSourceMap: \"minified.js.map\"\n});\n// same as before, it returns `code` and `map`\n```\n\nThe `inSourceMap` is only used if you also request `outSourceMap` (it makes\nno sense otherwise).\n\nOther options:\n\n- `warnings` (default `false`) — pass `true` to display compressor warnings.\n\n- `fromString` (default `false`) — if you pass `true` then you can pass\n  JavaScript source code, rather than file names.\n\n- `mangle` — pass `false` to skip mangling names.\n\n- `output` (default `null`) — pass an object if you wish to specify\n  additional [output options][codegen].  The defaults are optimized\n  for best compression.\n\n- `compress` (default `{}`) — pass `false` to skip compressing entirely.\n  Pass an object to specify custom [compressor options][compressor].\n\nWe could add more options to `UglifyJS.minify` — if you need additional\nfunctionality please suggest!\n\n### The hard way\n\nFollowing there's more detailed API info, in case the `minify` function is\ntoo simple for your needs.\n\n#### The parser\n```javascript\nvar toplevel_ast = UglifyJS.parse(code, options);\n```\n\n`options` is optional and if present it must be an object.  The following\nproperties are available:\n\n- `strict` — disable automatic semicolon insertion and support for trailing\n  comma in arrays and objects\n- `filename` — the name of the file where this code is coming from\n- `toplevel` — a `toplevel` node (as returned by a previous invocation of\n  `parse`)\n\nThe last two options are useful when you'd like to minify multiple files and\nget a single file as the output and a proper source map.  Our CLI tool does\nsomething like this:\n```javascript\nvar toplevel = null;\nfiles.forEach(function(file){\n\tvar code = fs.readFileSync(file);\n\ttoplevel = UglifyJS.parse(code, {\n\t\tfilename: file,\n\t\ttoplevel: toplevel\n\t});\n});\n```\n\nAfter this, we have in `toplevel` a big AST containing all our files, with\neach token having proper information about where it came from.\n\n#### Scope information\n\nUglifyJS contains a scope analyzer that you need to call manually before\ncompressing or mangling.  Basically it augments various nodes in the AST\nwith information about where is a name defined, how many times is a name\nreferenced, if it is a global or not, if a function is using `eval` or the\n`with` statement etc.  I will discuss this some place else, for now what's\nimportant to know is that you need to call the following before doing\nanything with the tree:\n```javascript\ntoplevel.figure_out_scope()\n```\n\n#### Compression\n\nLike this:\n```javascript\nvar compressor = UglifyJS.Compressor(options);\nvar compressed_ast = toplevel.transform(compressor);\n```\n\nThe `options` can be missing.  Available options are discussed above in\n“Compressor options”.  Defaults should lead to best compression in most\nscripts.\n\nThe compressor is destructive, so don't rely that `toplevel` remains the\noriginal tree.\n\n#### Mangling\n\nAfter compression it is a good idea to call again `figure_out_scope` (since\nthe compressor might drop unused variables / unreachable code and this might\nchange the number of identifiers or their position).  Optionally, you can\ncall a trick that helps after Gzip (counting character frequency in\nnon-mangleable words).  Example:\n```javascript\ncompressed_ast.figure_out_scope();\ncompressed_ast.compute_char_frequency();\ncompressed_ast.mangle_names();\n```\n\n#### Generating output\n\nAST nodes have a `print` method that takes an output stream.  Essentially,\nto generate code you do this:\n```javascript\nvar stream = UglifyJS.OutputStream(options);\ncompressed_ast.print(stream);\nvar code = stream.toString(); // this is your minified code\n```\n\nor, for a shortcut you can do:\n```javascript\nvar code = compressed_ast.print_to_string(options);\n```\n\nAs usual, `options` is optional.  The output stream accepts a lot of otions,\nmost of them documented above in section “Beautifier options”.  The two\nwhich we care about here are `source_map` and `comments`.\n\n#### Keeping comments in the output\n\nIn order to keep certain comments in the output you need to pass the\n`comments` option.  Pass a RegExp or a function.  If you pass a RegExp, only\nthose comments whose body matches the regexp will be kept.  Note that body\nmeans without the initial `//` or `/*`.  If you pass a function, it will be\ncalled for every comment in the tree and will receive two arguments: the\nnode that the comment is attached to, and the comment token itself.\n\nThe comment token has these properties:\n\n- `type`: \"comment1\" for single-line comments or \"comment2\" for multi-line\n  comments\n- `value`: the comment body\n- `pos` and `endpos`: the start/end positions (zero-based indexes) in the\n  original code where this comment appears\n- `line` and `col`: the line and column where this comment appears in the\n  original code\n- `file` — the file name of the original file\n- `nlb` — true if there was a newline before this comment in the original\n  code, or if this comment contains a newline.\n\nYour function should return `true` to keep the comment, or a falsy value\notherwise.\n\n#### Generating a source mapping\n\nYou need to pass the `source_map` argument when calling `print`.  It needs\nto be a `SourceMap` object (which is a thin wrapper on top of the\n[source-map][source-map] library).\n\nExample:\n```javascript\nvar source_map = UglifyJS.SourceMap(source_map_options);\nvar stream = UglifyJS.OutputStream({\n\t...\n\tsource_map: source_map\n});\ncompressed_ast.print(stream);\n\nvar code = stream.toString();\nvar map = source_map.toString(); // json output for your source map\n```\n\nThe `source_map_options` (optional) can contain the following properties:\n\n- `file`: the name of the JavaScript output file that this mapping refers to\n- `root`: the `sourceRoot` property (see the [spec][sm-spec])\n- `orig`: the \"original source map\", handy when you compress generated JS\n  and want to map the minified output back to the original code where it\n  came from.  It can be simply a string in JSON, or a JSON object containing\n  the original source map.\n\n  [acorn]: https://github.com/marijnh/acorn\n  [source-map]: https://github.com/mozilla/source-map\n  [sm-spec]: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1RGAehQwRypUTovF1KRlpiOFze0b-_2gc6fAH0KY0k/edit\n  [codegen]: http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/codegen\n  [compressor]: http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/compress\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","_id":"uglify-js@2.3.2","dist":{"shasum":"de195c311110e100ebf43b3e6bdc396827771469","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/uglify-js/-/uglify-js-2.3.2.tgz"},"_from":".","_npmVersion":"1.2.18","_npmUser":{"name":"mishoo","email":"mihai.bazon@gmail.com"},"directories":{}},"2.3.3":{"name":"uglify-js","description":"JavaScript parser, mangler/compressor and beautifier toolkit","homepage":"http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs","main":"tools/node.js","version":"2.3.3","engines":{"node":">=0.4.0"},"maintainers":[{"name":"caires","email":"cairesvs@gmail.com"},{"name":"mape","email":"mape@mape.me"},{"name":"mishoo","email":"mihai.bazon@gmail.com"}],"repositories":[{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2.git"}],"dependencies":{"async":"~0.2.6","source-map":"~0.1.7","optimist":"~0.3.5"},"bin":{"uglifyjs":"bin/uglifyjs"},"scripts":{"test":"node test/run-tests.js"},"readme":"UglifyJS 2\n==========\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mishoo/UglifyJS2.png)](https://travis-ci.org/mishoo/UglifyJS2)\n\nUglifyJS is a JavaScript parser, minifier, compressor or beautifier toolkit.\n\nThis page documents the command line utility.

It's recommended that you pass the\ninput files first, then pass the options.  UglifyJS will parse input files\nin sequence and apply any compression options.  The files are parsed in the\nsame global scope, that is, a reference from a file to some\nvariable/function declared in another file will be matched properly.\n\nIf you want to read from STDIN instead, pass a single dash instead of input\nfiles.\n\nThe available options are:\n\n    --source-map       Specify an output file where to generate source map.\n                                                                          [string]\n    --source-map-root  The path to the original source to be included in the\n                       source map.

[string]\n    --in-source-map    Input source map, useful if you're compressing JS that was\n                       generated from some other original code.\n    --screw-ie8        Pass this flag if you don't care about full compliance with\n                       Internet Explorer 6-8 quirks (by default UglifyJS will try\n                       to be IE-proof).\n    -p, --prefix       Skip prefix for original filenames that appear in source\n                       maps. For example -p 3 will drop 3 directories from file\n                       names and ensure they are relative paths.\n    -o, --output       Output file (default STDOUT).\n    -b, --beautify     Beautify output/specify output options.

By default this\n                       works like Google Closure, keeping JSDoc-style comments\n                       that contain \"@license\" or \"@preserve\". You can optionally\n                       pass one of the following arguments to this flag:\n                       - \"all\" to keep all comments\n                       - a valid JS regexp (needs to start with a slash) to keep\n                       only comments that match.\n                       Note that currently not *all* comments can be kept when\n                       compression is on, because of dead code removal or\n                       cascading statements into sequences.

You need to pass an\n                       argument to this option to specify the name that your\n                       module will take when included in, say, a browser.\n                                                                          [string]\n    --export-all       Only used when --wrap, this tells UglifyJS to add code to\n                       automatically export all globals.                 [boolean]\n    --lint             Display some scope warnings                       [boolean]\n    -v, --verbose      Verbose                                           [boolean]\n    -V, --version      Print version number and exit.                    [boolean]\n\nSpecify `--output` (`-o`) to declare the output file.  Otherwise the output\ngoes to STDOUT.\n\n## Source map options\n\nUglifyJS2 can generate a source map file, which is highly useful for\ndebugging your compressed JavaScript.  To get a source map, pass\n`--source-map output.js.map` (full path to the file where you want the\nsource map dumped).\n\nAdditionally you might need `--source-map-root` to pass the URL where the\noriginal files can be found.  In case you are passing full paths to input\nfiles to UglifyJS, you can use `--prefix` (`-p`) to specify the number of\ndirectories to drop from the path prefix when declaring files in the source\nmap.\n\nFor example:\n\n    uglifyjs /home/doe/work/foo/src/js/file1.js \\\n             /home/doe/work/foo/src/js/file2.js \\\n             -o foo.min.js \\\n             --source-map foo.min.js.map \\\n             --source-map-root http://foo.com/src \\\n             -p 5 -c -m\n\nThe above will compress and mangle `file1.js` and `file2.js`, will drop the\noutput in `foo.min.js` and the source map in `foo.min.js.map`.  The source\nmapping will refer to `http://foo.com/src/js/file1.js` and\n`http://foo.com/src/js/file2.js` (in fact it will list `http://foo.com/src`\nas the source map root, and the original files as `js/file1.js` and\n`js/file2.js`).\n\n### Composed source map\n\nWhen you're compressing JS code that was output by a compiler such as\nCoffeeScript, mapping to the JS code won't be too helpful.  Instead, you'd\nlike to map back to the original code (i.e. CoffeeScript).  UglifyJS has an\noption to take an input source map.  Assuming you have a mapping from\nCoffeeScript → compiled JS, UglifyJS can generate a map from CoffeeScript →\ncompressed JS by mapping every token in the compiled JS to its original\nlocation.\n\nTo use this feature you need to pass `--in-source-map\n/path/to/input/source.map`.  Normally the input source map should also point\nto the file containing the generated JS, so if that's correct you can omit\ninput files from the command line.\n\n## Mangler options\n\nTo enable the mangler you need to pass `--mangle` (`-m`).  The following\n(comma-separated) options are supported:\n\n- `sort` — to assign shorter names to most frequently used variables.  This\n  saves a few hundred bytes on jQuery before gzip, but the output is\n  _bigger_ after gzip (and seems to happen for other libraries I tried it\n  on) therefore it's not enabled by default.\n\n- `toplevel` — mangle names declared in the toplevel scope (disabled by\n  default).\n\n- `eval` — mangle names visible in scopes where `eval` or `when` are used\n  (disabled by default).\n\nWhen mangling is enabled but you want to prevent certain names from being\nmangled, you can declare those names with `--reserved` (`-r`) — pass a\ncomma-separated list of names.  For example:\n\n    uglifyjs ... -m -r '$,require,exports'\n\nto prevent the `require`, `exports` and `$` names from being changed.\n\n## Compressor options\n\nYou need to pass `--compress` (`-c`) to enable the compressor.  Optionally\nyou can pass a comma-separated list of options.  Options are in the form\n`foo=bar`, or just `foo` (the latter implies a boolean option that you want\nto set `true`; it's effectively a shortcut for `foo=true`).\n\n- `sequences` -- join consecutive simple statements using the comma operator\n- `properties` -- rewrite property access using the dot notation, for\n  example `foo[\"bar\"] → foo.bar`\n- `dead_code` -- remove unreachable code\n- `drop_debugger` -- remove `debugger;` statements\n- `unsafe` (default: false) -- apply \"unsafe\" transformations (discussion below)\n- `conditionals` -- apply optimizations for `if`-s and conditional\n  expressions\n- `comparisons` -- apply certain optimizations to binary nodes, for example:\n  `!(a <= b) → a > b` (only when `unsafe`), attempts to negate binary nodes,\n  e.g. `a = !b && !c && !d && !e → a=!(b||c||d||e)` etc.\n- `evaluate` -- attempt to evaluate constant expressions\n- `booleans` -- various optimizations for boolean context, for example `!!a\n  ? b : c → a ? b : c`\n- `loops` -- optimizations for `do`, `while` and `for` loops when we can\n  statically determine the condition\n- `unused` -- drop unreferenced functions and variables\n- `hoist_funs` -- hoist function declarations\n- `hoist_vars` (default: false) -- hoist `var` declarations (this is `false`\n  by default because it seems to increase the size of the output in general)\n- `if_return` -- optimizations for if/return and if/continue\n- `join_vars` -- join consecutive `var` statements\n- `cascade` -- small optimization for sequences, transform `x, x` into `x`\n  and `x = something(), x` into `x = something()`\n- `warnings` -- display warnings when dropping unreachable code or unused\n  declarations etc.\n\n### The `unsafe` option\n\nIt enables some transformations that *might* break code logic in certain\ncontrived cases, but should be fine for most code.  You might want to try it\non your own code, it should reduce the minified size.  Here's what happens\nwhen this flag is on:\n\n- `new Array(1, 2, 3)` or `Array(1, 2, 3)` → `[1, 2, 3 ]`\n- `new Object()` → `{}`\n- `String(exp)` or `exp.toString()` → `\"\" + exp`\n- `new Object/RegExp/Function/Error/Array (...)` → we discard the `new`\n- `typeof foo == \"undefined\"` → `foo === void 0`\n- `void 0` → `\"undefined\"` (if there is a variable named \"undefined\" in\n  scope; we do it because the variable name will be mangled, typically\n  reduced to a single character).\n\n### Conditional compilation\n\nYou can use the `--define` (`-d`) switch in order to declare global\nvariables that UglifyJS will assume to be constants (unless defined in\nscope).  For example if you pass `--define DEBUG=false` then, coupled with\ndead code removal UglifyJS will discard the following from the output:\n```javascript\nif (DEBUG) {\n\tconsole.log(\"debug stuff\");\n}\n```\n\nUglifyJS will warn about the condition being always false and about dropping\nunreachable code; for now there is no option to turn off only this specific\nwarning, you can pass `warnings=false` to turn off *all* warnings.\n\nAnother way of doing that is to declare your globals as constants in a\nseparate file and include it into the build.  For example you can have a\n`build/defines.js` file with the following:\n```javascript\nconst DEBUG = false;\nconst PRODUCTION = true;\n// etc.\n```\n\nand build your code like this:\n\n    uglifyjs build/defines.js js/foo.js js/bar.js... -c\n\nUglifyJS will notice the constants and, since they cannot be altered, it\nwill evaluate references to them to the value itself and drop unreachable\ncode as usual.  The possible downside of this approach is that the build\nwill contain the `const` declarations.\n\n<a name=\"codegen-options\"></a>\n## Beautifier options\n\nThe code generator tries to output shortest code possible by default.  In\ncase you want beautified output, pass `--beautify` (`-b`).  Optionally you\ncan pass additional arguments that control the code output:\n\n- `beautify` (default `true`) -- whether to actually beautify the output.\n  Passing `-b` will set this to true, but you might need to pass `-b` even\n  when you want to generate minified code, in order to specify additional\n  arguments, so you can use `-b beautify=false` to override it.\n- `indent-level` (default 4)\n- `indent-start` (default 0) -- prefix all lines by that many spaces\n- `quote-keys` (default `false`) -- pass `true` to quote all keys in literal\n  objects\n- `space-colon` (default `true`) -- insert a space after the colon signs\n- `ascii-only` (default `false`) -- escape Unicode characters in strings and\n  regexps\n- `inline-script` (default `false`) -- escape the slash in occurrences of\n  `</script` in strings\n- `width` (default 80) -- only takes effect when beautification is on, this\n  specifies an (orientative) line width that the beautifier will try to\n  obey.  It refers to the width of the line text (excluding indentation).\n  It doesn't work very well currently, but it does make the code generated\n  by UglifyJS more readable.\n- `max-line-len` (default 32000) -- maximum line length (for uglified code)\n- `ie-proof` (default `true`) -- generate “IE-proof” code (for now this\n  means add brackets around the do/while in code like this: `if (foo) do\n  something(); while (bar); else ...`.\n- `bracketize` (default `false`) -- always insert brackets in `if`, `for`,\n  `do`, `while` or `with` statements, even if their body is a single\n  statement.\n- `semicolons` (default `true`) -- separate statements with semicolons.  If\n  you pass `false` then whenever possible we will use a newline instead of a\n  semicolon, leading to more readable output of uglified code (size before\n  gzip could be smaller; size after gzip insignificantly larger).\n\n### Keeping copyright notices or other comments\n\nYou can pass `--comments` to retain certain comments in the output.  By\ndefault it will keep JSDoc-style comments that contain \"@preserve\",\n\"@license\" or \"@cc_on\" (conditional compilation for IE).  You can pass\n`--comments all` to keep all the comments, or a valid JavaScript regexp to\nkeep only comments that match this regexp.  For example `--comments\n'/foo|bar/'` will keep only comments that contain \"foo\" or \"bar\".\n\nNote, however, that there might be situations where comments are lost.  For\nexample:\n```javascript\nfunction f() {\n\t/** @preserve Foo Bar */\n\tfunction g() {\n\t  // this function is never called\n\t}\n\treturn something();\n}\n```\n\nEven though it has \"@preserve\", the comment will be lost because the inner\nfunction `g` (which is the AST node to which the comment is attached to) is\ndiscarded by the compressor as not referenced.\n\nThe safest comments where to place copyright information (or other info that\nneeds to be kept in the output) are comments attached to toplevel nodes.\n\n## Support for the SpiderMonkey AST\n\nUglifyJS2 has its own abstract syntax tree format; for\n[practical reasons](http://lisperator.net/blog/uglifyjs-why-not-switching-to-spidermonkey-ast/)\nwe can't easily change to using the SpiderMonkey AST internally.  However,\nUglifyJS now has a converter which can import a SpiderMonkey AST.\n\nFor example [Acorn][acorn] is a super-fast parser that produces a\nSpiderMonkey AST.  It has a small CLI utility that parses one file and dumps\nthe AST in JSON on the standard output.  To use UglifyJS to mangle and\ncompress that:\n\n    acorn file.js | uglifyjs --spidermonkey -m -c\n\nThe `--spidermonkey` option tells UglifyJS that all input files are not\nJavaScript, but JS code described in SpiderMonkey AST in JSON.  Therefore we\ndon't use our own parser in this case, but just transform that AST into our\ninternal AST.\n\n### Use Acorn for parsing\n\nMore for fun, I added the `--acorn` option which will use Acorn to do all\nthe parsing.  If you pass this option, UglifyJS will `require(\"acorn\")`.\n\nAcorn is really fast (e.g. 250ms instead of 380ms on some 650K code), but\nconverting the SpiderMonkey tree that Acorn produces takes another 150ms so\nin total it's a bit more than just using UglifyJS's own parser.\n\nAPI Reference\n-------------\n\nAssuming installation via NPM, you can load UglifyJS in your application\nlike this:\n```javascript\nvar UglifyJS = require(\"uglify-js\");\n```\n\nIt exports a lot of names, but I'll discuss here the basics that are needed\nfor parsing, mangling and compressing a piece of code.  The sequence is (1)\nparse, (2) compress, (3) mangle, (4) generate output code.\n\n### The simple way\n\nThere's a single toplevel function which combines all the steps.  If you\ndon't need additional customization, you might want to go with `minify`.\nExample:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify(\"/path/to/file.js\");\nconsole.log(result.code); // minified output\n// if you need to pass code instead of file name\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify(\"var b = function () {};\", {fromString: true});\n```\n\nYou can also compress multiple files:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ]);\nconsole.log(result.code);\n```\n\nTo generate a source map:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ], {\n\toutSourceMap: \"out.js.map\"\n});\nconsole.log(result.code); // minified output\nconsole.log(result.map);\n```\n\nNote that the source map is not saved in a file, it's just returned in\n`result.map`.  The value passed for `outSourceMap` is only used to set the\n`file` attribute in the source map (see [the spec][sm-spec]).\n\nYou can also specify sourceRoot property to be included in source map:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ], {\n\toutSourceMap: \"out.js.map\",\n\tsourceRoot: \"http://example.com/src\"\n});\n```\n\nIf you're compressing compiled JavaScript and have a source map for it, you\ncan use the `inSourceMap` argument:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify(\"compiled.js\", {\n\tinSourceMap: \"compiled.js.map\",\n\toutSourceMap: \"minified.js.map\"\n});\n// same as before, it returns `code` and `map`\n```\n\nThe `inSourceMap` is only used if you also request `outSourceMap` (it makes\nno sense otherwise).\n\nOther options:\n\n- `warnings` (default `false`) — pass `true` to display compressor warnings.\n\n- `fromString` (default `false`) — if you pass `true` then you can pass\n  JavaScript source code, rather than file names.\n\n- `mangle` — pass `false` to skip mangling names.\n\n- `output` (default `null`) — pass an object if you wish to specify\n  additional [output options][codegen].  The defaults are optimized\n  for best compression.\n\n- `compress` (default `{}`) — pass `false` to skip compressing entirely.\n  Pass an object to specify custom [compressor options][compressor].\n\nWe could add more options to `UglifyJS.minify` — if you need additional\nfunctionality please suggest!\n\n### The hard way\n\nFollowing there's more detailed API info, in case the `minify` function is\ntoo simple for your needs.\n\n#### The parser\n```javascript\nvar toplevel_ast = UglifyJS.parse(code, options);\n```\n\n`options` is optional and if present it must be an object.  The following\nproperties are available:\n\n- `strict` — disable automatic semicolon insertion and support for trailing\n  comma in arrays and objects\n- `filename` — the name of the file where this code is coming from\n- `toplevel` — a `toplevel` node (as returned by a previous invocation of\n  `parse`)\n\nThe last two options are useful when you'd like to minify multiple files and\nget a single file as the output and a proper source map.  Our CLI tool does\nsomething like this:\n```javascript\nvar toplevel = null;\nfiles.forEach(function(file){\n\tvar code = fs.readFileSync(file);\n\ttoplevel = UglifyJS.parse(code, {\n\t\tfilename: file,\n\t\ttoplevel: toplevel\n\t});\n});\n```\n\nAfter this, we have in `toplevel` a big AST containing all our files, with\neach token having proper information about where it came from.\n\n#### Scope information\n\nUglifyJS contains a scope analyzer that you need to call manually before\ncompressing or mangling.  Basically it augments various nodes in the AST\nwith information about where is a name defined, how many times is a name\nreferenced, if it is a global or not, if a function is using `eval` or the\n`with` statement etc.  I will discuss this some place else, for now what's\nimportant to know is that you need to call the following before doing\nanything with the tree:\n```javascript\ntoplevel.figure_out_scope()\n```\n\n#### Compression\n\nLike this:\n```javascript\nvar compressor = UglifyJS.Compressor(options);\nvar compressed_ast = toplevel.transform(compressor);\n```\n\nThe `options` can be missing.  Available options are discussed above in\n“Compressor options”.  Defaults should lead to best compression in most\nscripts.\n\nThe compressor is destructive, so don't rely that `toplevel` remains the\noriginal tree.\n\n#### Mangling\n\nAfter compression it is a good idea to call again `figure_out_scope` (since\nthe compressor might drop unused variables / unreachable code and this might\nchange the number of identifiers or their position).  Optionally, you can\ncall a trick that helps after Gzip (counting character frequency in\nnon-mangleable words).  Example:\n```javascript\ncompressed_ast.figure_out_scope();\ncompressed_ast.compute_char_frequency();\ncompressed_ast.mangle_names();\n```\n\n#### Generating output\n\nAST nodes have a `print` method that takes an output stream.  Essentially,\nto generate code you do this:\n```javascript\nvar stream = UglifyJS.OutputStream(options);\ncompressed_ast.print(stream);\nvar code = stream.toString(); // this is your minified code\n```\n\nor, for a shortcut you can do:\n```javascript\nvar code = compressed_ast.print_to_string(options);\n```\n\nAs usual, `options` is optional.  The output stream accepts a lot of otions,\nmost of them documented above in section “Beautifier options”.  The two\nwhich we care about here are `source_map` and `comments`.\n\n#### Keeping comments in the output\n\nIn order to keep certain comments in the output you need to pass the\n`comments` option.  Pass a RegExp or a function.  If you pass a RegExp, only\nthose comments whose body matches the regexp will be kept.  Note that body\nmeans without the initial `//` or `/*`.  If you pass a function, it will be\ncalled for every comment in the tree and will receive two arguments: the\nnode that the comment is attached to, and the comment token itself.\n\nThe comment token has these properties:\n\n- `type`: \"comment1\" for single-line comments or \"comment2\" for multi-line\n  comments\n- `value`: the comment body\n- `pos` and `endpos`: the start/end positions (zero-based indexes) in the\n  original code where this comment appears\n- `line` and `col`: the line and column where this comment appears in the\n  original code\n- `file` — the file name of the original file\n- `nlb` — true if there was a newline before this comment in the original\n  code, or if this comment contains a newline.\n\nYour function should return `true` to keep the comment, or a falsy value\notherwise.\n\n#### Generating a source mapping\n\nYou need to pass the `source_map` argument when calling `print`.  It needs\nto be a `SourceMap` object (which is a thin wrapper on top of the\n[source-map][source-map] library).\n\nExample:\n```javascript\nvar source_map = UglifyJS.SourceMap(source_map_options);\nvar stream = UglifyJS.OutputStream({\n\t...\n\tsource_map: source_map\n});\ncompressed_ast.print(stream);\n\nvar code = stream.toString();\nvar map = source_map.toString(); // json output for your source map\n```\n\nThe `source_map_options` (optional) can contain the following properties:\n\n- `file`: the name of the JavaScript output file that this mapping refers to\n- `root`: the `sourceRoot` property (see the [spec][sm-spec])\n- `orig`: the \"original source map\", handy when you compress generated JS\n  and want to map the minified output back to the original code where it\n  came from.  It can be simply a string in JSON, or a JSON object containing\n  the original source map.\n\n  [acorn]: https://github.com/marijnh/acorn\n  [source-map]: https://github.com/mozilla/source-map\n  [sm-spec]: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1RGAehQwRypUTovF1KRlpiOFze0b-_2gc6fAH0KY0k/edit\n  [codegen]: http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/codegen\n  [compressor]: http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/compress\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","_id":"uglify-js@2.3.3","dist":{"shasum":"ea82ebd16f75440dc1406a9caa0555050e19a0d8","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/uglify-js/-/uglify-js-2.3.3.tgz"},"_from":".","_npmVersion":"1.2.18","_npmUser":{"name":"mishoo","email":"mihai.bazon@gmail.com"},"directories":{}},"2.3.4":{"name":"uglify-js","description":"JavaScript parser, mangler/compressor and beautifier toolkit","homepage":"http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs","main":"tools/node.js","version":"2.3.4","engines":{"node":">=0.4.0"},"maintainers":[{"name":"caires","email":"cairesvs@gmail.com"},{"name":"mape","email":"mape@mape.me"},{"name":"mishoo","email":"mihai.bazon@gmail.com"}],"repositories":[{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2.git"}],"dependencies":{"async":"~0.2.6","source-map":"~0.1.7","optimist":"~0.3.5"},"bin":{"uglifyjs":"bin/uglifyjs"},"scripts":{"test":"node test/run-tests.js"},"readme":"UglifyJS 2\n==========\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mishoo/UglifyJS2.png)](https://travis-ci.org/mishoo/UglifyJS2)\n\nUglifyJS is a JavaScript parser, minifier, compressor or beautifier toolkit.\n\nThis page documents the command line utility.

It's recommended that you pass the\ninput files first, then pass the options.  UglifyJS will parse input files\nin sequence and apply any compression options.  The files are parsed in the\nsame global scope, that is, a reference from a file to some\nvariable/function declared in another file will be matched properly.\n\nIf you want to read from STDIN instead, pass a single dash instead of input\nfiles.\n\nThe available options are:\n\n    --source-map       Specify an output file where to generate source map.\n                                                                          [string]\n    --source-map-root  The path to the original source to be included in the\n                       source map.                                        [string]\n    --source-map-url   The path to the source map to be added in //@\n                       sourceMappingURL.  Defaults to the value passed with\n                       --source-map.                                      [string]\n    --in-source-map    Input source map, useful if you're compressing JS that was\n                       generated from some other original code.\n    --screw-ie8        Pass this flag if you don't care about full compliance with\n                       Internet Explorer 6-8 quirks (by default UglifyJS will try\n                       to be IE-proof).\n    -p, --prefix       Skip prefix for original filenames that appear in source\n                       maps. For example -p 3 will drop 3 directories from file\n                       names and ensure they are relative paths.\n    -o, --output       Output file (default STDOUT).\n    -b, --beautify     Beautify output/specify output options.

Pass options\n                       like -c hoist_vars=false,if_return=false. Use -c with no\n                       argument to use the default compression options.   [string]\n    -d, --define       Global definitions                                 [string]\n    --comments         Preserve copyright comments in the output. By default this\n                       works like Google Closure, keeping JSDoc-style comments\n                       that contain \"@license\" or \"@preserve\". You can optionally\n                       pass one of the following arguments to this flag:\n                       - \"all\" to keep all comments\n                       - a valid JS regexp (needs to start with a slash) to keep\n                       only comments that match.\n                       Note that currently not *all* comments can be kept when\n                       compression is on, because of dead code removal or\n                       cascading statements into sequences.               [string]\n    --stats            Display operations run time on STDERR.            [boolean]\n    --acorn            Use Acorn for parsing.                            [boolean]\n    --spidermonkey     Assume input files are SpiderMonkey AST format (as JSON).\n                                                                         [boolean]\n    --self             Build itself (UglifyJS2) as a library (implies\n                       --wrap=UglifyJS --export-all)                     [boolean]\n    --wrap             Embed everything in a big function, making the “exports”\n                       and “global” variables available. You need to pass an\n                       argument to this option to specify the name that your\n                       module will take when included in, say, a browser.\n                                                                          [string]\n    --export-all       Only used when --wrap, this tells UglifyJS to add code to\n                       automatically export all globals.                 [boolean]\n    --lint             Display some scope warnings                       [boolean]\n    -v, --verbose      Verbose                                           [boolean]\n    -V, --version      Print version number and exit.                    [boolean]\n\nSpecify `--output` (`-o`) to declare the output file.  Otherwise the output\ngoes to STDOUT.\n\n## Source map options\n\nUglifyJS2 can generate a source map file, which is highly useful for\ndebugging your compressed JavaScript.  To get a source map, pass\n`--source-map output.js.map` (full path to the file where you want the\nsource map dumped).\n\nAdditionally you might need `--source-map-root` to pass the URL where the\noriginal files can be found.  In case you are passing full paths to input\nfiles to UglifyJS, you can use `--prefix` (`-p`) to specify the number of\ndirectories to drop from the path prefix when declaring files in the source\nmap.\n\nFor example:\n\n    uglifyjs /home/doe/work/foo/src/js/file1.js \\\n             /home/doe/work/foo/src/js/file2.js \\\n             -o foo.min.js \\\n             --source-map foo.min.js.map \\\n             --source-map-root http://foo.com/src \\\n             -p 5 -c -m\n\nThe above will compress and mangle `file1.js` and `file2.js`, will drop the\noutput in `foo.min.js` and the source map in `foo.min.js.map`.  The source\nmapping will refer to `http://foo.com/src/js/file1.js` and\n`http://foo.com/src/js/file2.js` (in fact it will list `http://foo.com/src`\nas the source map root, and the original files as `js/file1.js` and\n`js/file2.js`).\n\n### Composed source map\n\nWhen you're compressing JS code that was output by a compiler such as\nCoffeeScript, mapping to the JS code won't be too helpful.  Instead, you'd\nlike to map back to the original code (i.e. CoffeeScript).  UglifyJS has an\noption to take an input source map.  Assuming you have a mapping from\nCoffeeScript → compiled JS, UglifyJS can generate a map from CoffeeScript →\ncompressed JS by mapping every token in the compiled JS to its original\nlocation.\n\nTo use this feature you need to pass `--in-source-map\n/path/to/input/source.map`.  Normally the input source map should also point\nto the file containing the generated JS, so if that's correct you can omit\ninput files from the command line.\n\n## Mangler options\n\nTo enable the mangler you need to pass `--mangle` (`-m`).  The following\n(comma-separated) options are supported:\n\n- `sort` — to assign shorter names to most frequently used variables.  This\n  saves a few hundred bytes on jQuery before gzip, but the output is\n  _bigger_ after gzip (and seems to happen for other libraries I tried it\n  on) therefore it's not enabled by default.\n\n- `toplevel` — mangle names declared in the toplevel scope (disabled by\n  default).\n\n- `eval` — mangle names visible in scopes where `eval` or `when` are used\n  (disabled by default).\n\nWhen mangling is enabled but you want to prevent certain names from being\nmangled, you can declare those names with `--reserved` (`-r`) — pass a\ncomma-separated list of names.  For example:\n\n    uglifyjs ... -m -r '$,require,exports'\n\nto prevent the `require`, `exports` and `$` names from being changed.\n\n## Compressor options\n\nYou need to pass `--compress` (`-c`) to enable the compressor.  Optionally\nyou can pass a comma-separated list of options.  Options are in the form\n`foo=bar`, or just `foo` (the latter implies a boolean option that you want\nto set `true`; it's effectively a shortcut for `foo=true`).\n\n- `sequences` -- join consecutive simple statements using the comma operator\n- `properties` -- rewrite property access using the dot notation, for\n  example `foo[\"bar\"] → foo.bar`\n- `dead_code` -- remove unreachable code\n- `drop_debugger` -- remove `debugger;` statements\n- `unsafe` (default: false) -- apply \"unsafe\" transformations (discussion below)\n- `conditionals` -- apply optimizations for `if`-s and conditional\n  expressions\n- `comparisons` -- apply certain optimizations to binary nodes, for example:\n  `!(a <= b) → a > b` (only when `unsafe`), attempts to negate binary nodes,\n  e.g. `a = !b && !c && !d && !e → a=!(b||c||d||e)` etc.\n- `evaluate` -- attempt to evaluate constant expressions\n- `booleans` -- various optimizations for boolean context, for example `!!a\n  ? b : c → a ? b : c`\n- `loops` -- optimizations for `do`, `while` and `for` loops when we can\n  statically determine the condition\n- `unused` -- drop unreferenced functions and variables\n- `hoist_funs` -- hoist function declarations\n- `hoist_vars` (default: false) -- hoist `var` declarations (this is `false`\n  by default because it seems to increase the size of the output in general)\n- `if_return` -- optimizations for if/return and if/continue\n- `join_vars` -- join consecutive `var` statements\n- `cascade` -- small optimization for sequences, transform `x, x` into `x`\n  and `x = something(), x` into `x = something()`\n- `warnings` -- display warnings when dropping unreachable code or unused\n  declarations etc.\n\n### The `unsafe` option\n\nIt enables some transformations that *might* break code logic in certain\ncontrived cases, but should be fine for most code.  You might want to try it\non your own code, it should reduce the minified size.  Here's what happens\nwhen this flag is on:\n\n- `new Array(1, 2, 3)` or `Array(1, 2, 3)` → `[1, 2, 3 ]`\n- `new Object()` → `{}`\n- `String(exp)` or `exp.toString()` → `\"\" + exp`\n- `new Object/RegExp/Function/Error/Array (...)` → we discard the `new`\n- `typeof foo == \"undefined\"` → `foo === void 0`\n- `void 0` → `\"undefined\"` (if there is a variable named \"undefined\" in\n  scope; we do it because the variable name will be mangled, typically\n  reduced to a single character).\n\n### Conditional compilation\n\nYou can use the `--define` (`-d`) switch in order to declare global\nvariables that UglifyJS will assume to be constants (unless defined in\nscope).  For example if you pass `--define DEBUG=false` then, coupled with\ndead code removal UglifyJS will discard the following from the output:\n```javascript\nif (DEBUG) {\n\tconsole.log(\"debug stuff\");\n}\n```\n\nUglifyJS will warn about the condition being always false and about dropping\nunreachable code; for now there is no option to turn off only this specific\nwarning, you can pass `warnings=false` to turn off *all* warnings.\n\nAnother way of doing that is to declare your globals as constants in a\nseparate file and include it into the build.  For example you can have a\n`build/defines.js` file with the following:\n```javascript\nconst DEBUG = false;\nconst PRODUCTION = true;\n// etc.\n```\n\nand build your code like this:\n\n    uglifyjs build/defines.js js/foo.js js/bar.js... -c\n\nUglifyJS will notice the constants and, since they cannot be altered, it\nwill evaluate references to them to the value itself and drop unreachable\ncode as usual.  The possible downside of this approach is that the build\nwill contain the `const` declarations.\n\n<a name=\"codegen-options\"></a>\n## Beautifier options\n\nThe code generator tries to output shortest code possible by default.  In\ncase you want beautified output, pass `--beautify` (`-b`).  Optionally you\ncan pass additional arguments that control the code output:\n\n- `beautify` (default `true`) -- whether to actually beautify the output.\n  Passing `-b` will set this to true, but you might need to pass `-b` even\n  when you want to generate minified code, in order to specify additional\n  arguments, so you can use `-b beautify=false` to override it.\n- `indent-level` (default 4)\n- `indent-start` (default 0) -- prefix all lines by that many spaces\n- `quote-keys` (default `false`) -- pass `true` to quote all keys in literal\n  objects\n- `space-colon` (default `true`) -- insert a space after the colon signs\n- `ascii-only` (default `false`) -- escape Unicode characters in strings and\n  regexps\n- `inline-script` (default `false`) -- escape the slash in occurrences of\n  `</script` in strings\n- `width` (default 80) -- only takes effect when beautification is on, this\n  specifies an (orientative) line width that the beautifier will try to\n  obey.  It refers to the width of the line text (excluding indentation).\n  It doesn't work very well currently, but it does make the code generated\n  by UglifyJS more readable.\n- `max-line-len` (default 32000) -- maximum line length (for uglified code)\n- `ie-proof` (default `true`) -- generate “IE-proof” code (for now this\n  means add brackets around the do/while in code like this: `if (foo) do\n  something(); while (bar); else ...`.\n- `bracketize` (default `false`) -- always insert brackets in `if`, `for`,\n  `do`, `while` or `with` statements, even if their body is a single\n  statement.\n- `semicolons` (default `true`) -- separate statements with semicolons.  If\n  you pass `false` then whenever possible we will use a newline instead of a\n  semicolon, leading to more readable output of uglified code (size before\n  gzip could be smaller; size after gzip insignificantly larger).\n\n### Keeping copyright notices or other comments\n\nYou can pass `--comments` to retain certain comments in the output.  By\ndefault it will keep JSDoc-style comments that contain \"@preserve\",\n\"@license\" or \"@cc_on\" (conditional compilation for IE).  You can pass\n`--comments all` to keep all the comments, or a valid JavaScript regexp to\nkeep only comments that match this regexp.  For example `--comments\n'/foo|bar/'` will keep only comments that contain \"foo\" or \"bar\".\n\nNote, however, that there might be situations where comments are lost.  For\nexample:\n```javascript\nfunction f() {\n\t/** @preserve Foo Bar */\n\tfunction g() {\n\t  // this function is never called\n\t}\n\treturn something();\n}\n```\n\nEven though it has \"@preserve\", the comment will be lost because the inner\nfunction `g` (which is the AST node to which the comment is attached to) is\ndiscarded by the compressor as not referenced.\n\nThe safest comments where to place copyright information (or other info that\nneeds to be kept in the output) are comments attached to toplevel nodes.\n\n## Support for the SpiderMonkey AST\n\nUglifyJS2 has its own abstract syntax tree format; for\n[practical reasons](http://lisperator.net/blog/uglifyjs-why-not-switching-to-spidermonkey-ast/)\nwe can't easily change to using the SpiderMonkey AST internally.  However,\nUglifyJS now has a converter which can import a SpiderMonkey AST.\n\nFor example [Acorn][acorn] is a super-fast parser that produces a\nSpiderMonkey AST.  It has a small CLI utility that parses one file and dumps\nthe AST in JSON on the standard output.  To use UglifyJS to mangle and\ncompress that:\n\n    acorn file.js | uglifyjs --spidermonkey -m -c\n\nThe `--spidermonkey` option tells UglifyJS that all input files are not\nJavaScript, but JS code described in SpiderMonkey AST in JSON.  Therefore we\ndon't use our own parser in this case, but just transform that AST into our\ninternal AST.\n\n### Use Acorn for parsing\n\nMore for fun, I added the `--acorn` option which will use Acorn to do all\nthe parsing.  If you pass this option, UglifyJS will `require(\"acorn\")`.\n\nAcorn is really fast (e.g. 250ms instead of 380ms on some 650K code), but\nconverting the SpiderMonkey tree that Acorn produces takes another 150ms so\nin total it's a bit more than just using UglifyJS's own parser.\n\nAPI Reference\n-------------\n\nAssuming installation via NPM, you can load UglifyJS in your application\nlike this:\n```javascript\nvar UglifyJS = require(\"uglify-js\");\n```\n\nIt exports a lot of names, but I'll discuss here the basics that are needed\nfor parsing, mangling and compressing a piece of code.  The sequence is (1)\nparse, (2) compress, (3) mangle, (4) generate output code.\n\n### The simple way\n\nThere's a single toplevel function which combines all the steps.  If you\ndon't need additional customization, you might want to go with `minify`.\nExample:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify(\"/path/to/file.js\");\nconsole.log(result.code); // minified output\n// if you need to pass code instead of file name\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify(\"var b = function () {};\", {fromString: true});\n```\n\nYou can also compress multiple files:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ]);\nconsole.log(result.code);\n```\n\nTo generate a source map:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ], {\n\toutSourceMap: \"out.js.map\"\n});\nconsole.log(result.code); // minified output\nconsole.log(result.map);\n```\n\nNote that the source map is not saved in a file, it's just returned in\n`result.map`.  The value passed for `outSourceMap` is only used to set the\n`file` attribute in the source map (see [the spec][sm-spec]).\n\nYou can also specify sourceRoot property to be included in source map:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ], {\n\toutSourceMap: \"out.js.map\",\n\tsourceRoot: \"http://example.com/src\"\n});\n```\n\nIf you're compressing compiled JavaScript and have a source map for it, you\ncan use the `inSourceMap` argument:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify(\"compiled.js\", {\n\tinSourceMap: \"compiled.js.map\",\n\toutSourceMap: \"minified.js.map\"\n});\n// same as before, it returns `code` and `map`\n```\n\nThe `inSourceMap` is only used if you also request `outSourceMap` (it makes\nno sense otherwise).\n\nOther options:\n\n- `warnings` (default `false`) — pass `true` to display compressor warnings.\n\n- `fromString` (default `false`) — if you pass `true` then you can pass\n  JavaScript source code, rather than file names.\n\n- `mangle` — pass `false` to skip mangling names.\n\n- `output` (default `null`) — pass an object if you wish to specify\n  additional [output options][codegen].  The defaults are optimized\n  for best compression.\n\n- `compress` (default `{}`) — pass `false` to skip compressing entirely.\n  Pass an object to specify custom [compressor options][compressor].\n\nWe could add more options to `UglifyJS.minify` — if you need additional\nfunctionality please suggest!\n\n### The hard way\n\nFollowing there's more detailed API info, in case the `minify` function is\ntoo simple for your needs.\n\n#### The parser\n```javascript\nvar toplevel_ast = UglifyJS.parse(code, options);\n```\n\n`options` is optional and if present it must be an object.  The following\nproperties are available:\n\n- `strict` — disable automatic semicolon insertion and support for trailing\n  comma in arrays and objects\n- `filename` — the name of the file where this code is coming from\n- `toplevel` — a `toplevel` node (as returned by a previous invocation of\n  `parse`)\n\nThe last two options are useful when you'd like to minify multiple files and\nget a single file as the output and a proper source map.  Our CLI tool does\nsomething like this:\n```javascript\nvar toplevel = null;\nfiles.forEach(function(file){\n\tvar code = fs.readFileSync(file);\n\ttoplevel = UglifyJS.parse(code, {\n\t\tfilename: file,\n\t\ttoplevel: toplevel\n\t});\n});\n```\n\nAfter this, we have in `toplevel` a big AST containing all our files, with\neach token having proper information about where it came from.\n\n#### Scope information\n\nUglifyJS contains a scope analyzer that you need to call manually before\ncompressing or mangling.  Basically it augments various nodes in the AST\nwith information about where is a name defined, how many times is a name\nreferenced, if it is a global or not, if a function is using `eval` or the\n`with` statement etc.  I will discuss this some place else, for now what's\nimportant to know is that you need to call the following before doing\nanything with the tree:\n```javascript\ntoplevel.figure_out_scope()\n```\n\n#### Compression\n\nLike this:\n```javascript\nvar compressor = UglifyJS.Compressor(options);\nvar compressed_ast = toplevel.transform(compressor);\n```\n\nThe `options` can be missing.  Available options are discussed above in\n“Compressor options”.  Defaults should lead to best compression in most\nscripts.\n\nThe compressor is destructive, so don't rely that `toplevel` remains the\noriginal tree.\n\n#### Mangling\n\nAfter compression it is a good idea to call again `figure_out_scope` (since\nthe compressor might drop unused variables / unreachable code and this might\nchange the number of identifiers or their position).  Optionally, you can\ncall a trick that helps after Gzip (counting character frequency in\nnon-mangleable words).  Example:\n```javascript\ncompressed_ast.figure_out_scope();\ncompressed_ast.compute_char_frequency();\ncompressed_ast.mangle_names();\n```\n\n#### Generating output\n\nAST nodes have a `print` method that takes an output stream.  Essentially,\nto generate code you do this:\n```javascript\nvar stream = UglifyJS.OutputStream(options);\ncompressed_ast.print(stream);\nvar code = stream.toString(); // this is your minified code\n```\n\nor, for a shortcut you can do:\n```javascript\nvar code = compressed_ast.print_to_string(options);\n```\n\nAs usual, `options` is optional.  The output stream accepts a lot of otions,\nmost of them documented above in section “Beautifier options”.  The two\nwhich we care about here are `source_map` and `comments`.\n\n#### Keeping comments in the output\n\nIn order to keep certain comments in the output you need to pass the\n`comments` option.  Pass a RegExp or a function.  If you pass a RegExp, only\nthose comments whose body matches the regexp will be kept.  Note that body\nmeans without the initial `//` or `/*`.  If you pass a function, it will be\ncalled for every comment in the tree and will receive two arguments: the\nnode that the comment is attached to, and the comment token itself.\n\nThe comment token has these properties:\n\n- `type`: \"comment1\" for single-line comments or \"comment2\" for multi-line\n  comments\n- `value`: the comment body\n- `pos` and `endpos`: the start/end positions (zero-based indexes) in the\n  original code where this comment appears\n- `line` and `col`: the line and column where this comment appears in the\n  original code\n- `file` — the file name of the original file\n- `nlb` — true if there was a newline before this comment in the original\n  code, or if this comment contains a newline.\n\nYour function should return `true` to keep the comment, or a falsy value\notherwise.\n\n#### Generating a source mapping\n\nYou need to pass the `source_map` argument when calling `print`.  It needs\nto be a `SourceMap` object (which is a thin wrapper on top of the\n[source-map][source-map] library).\n\nExample:\n```javascript\nvar source_map = UglifyJS.SourceMap(source_map_options);\nvar stream = UglifyJS.OutputStream({\n\t...\n\tsource_map: source_map\n});\ncompressed_ast.print(stream);\n\nvar code = stream.toString();\nvar map = source_map.toString(); // json output for your source map\n```\n\nThe `source_map_options` (optional) can contain the following properties:\n\n- `file`: the name of the JavaScript output file that this mapping refers to\n- `root`: the `sourceRoot` property (see the [spec][sm-spec])\n- `orig`: the \"original source map\", handy when you compress generated JS\n  and want to map the minified output back to the original code where it\n  came from.  It can be simply a string in JSON, or a JSON object containing\n  the original source map.\n\n  [acorn]: https://github.com/marijnh/acorn\n  [source-map]: https://github.com/mozilla/source-map\n  [sm-spec]: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1RGAehQwRypUTovF1KRlpiOFze0b-_2gc6fAH0KY0k/edit\n  [codegen]: http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/codegen\n  [compressor]: http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/compress\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","_id":"uglify-js@2.3.4","dist":{"shasum":"321cd1f7b46c7fa4a0cc76fc194142de0b0d2e40","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/uglify-js/-/uglify-js-2.3.4.tgz"},"_from":".","_npmVersion":"1.2.18","_npmUser":{"name":"mishoo","email":"mihai.bazon@gmail.com"},"directories":{}},"2.3.5":{"name":"uglify-js","description":"JavaScript parser, mangler/compressor and beautifier toolkit","homepage":"http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs","main":"tools/node.js","version":"2.3.5","engines":{"node":">=0.4.0"},"maintainers":[{"name":"caires","email":"cairesvs@gmail.com"},{"name":"mape","email":"mape@mape.me"},{"name":"mishoo","email":"mihai.bazon@gmail.com"}],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2.git"},"dependencies":{"async":"~0.2.6","source-map":"~0.1.7","optimist":"~0.3.5"},"bin":{"uglifyjs":"bin/uglifyjs"},"scripts":{"test":"node test/run-tests.js"},"readme":"UglifyJS 2\n==========\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mishoo/UglifyJS2.png)](https://travis-ci.org/mishoo/UglifyJS2)\n\nUglifyJS is a JavaScript parser, minifier, compressor or beautifier toolkit.\n\nThis page documents the command line utility.

It's recommended that you pass the\ninput files first, then pass the options.  UglifyJS will parse input files\nin sequence and apply any compression options.  The files are parsed in the\nsame global scope, that is, a reference from a file to some\nvariable/function declared in another file will be matched properly.\n\nIf you want to read from STDIN instead, pass a single dash instead of input\nfiles.\n\nThe available options are:\n\n    --source-map       Specify an output file where to generate source map.\n                                                                          [string]\n    --source-map-root  The path to the original source to be included in the\n                       source map.                                        [string]\n    --source-map-url   The path to the source map to be added in //@\n                       sourceMappingURL.  Defaults to the value passed with\n                       --source-map.                                      [string]\n    --in-source-map    Input source map, useful if you're compressing JS that was\n                       generated from some other original code.\n    --screw-ie8        Pass this flag if you don't care about full compliance with\n                       Internet Explorer 6-8 quirks (by default UglifyJS will try\n                       to be IE-proof).\n    -p, --prefix       Skip prefix for original filenames that appear in source\n                       maps. For example -p 3 will drop 3 directories from file\n                       names and ensure they are relative paths.\n    -o, --output       Output file (default STDOUT).\n    -b, --beautify     Beautify output/specify output options.

Pass options\n                       like -c hoist_vars=false,if_return=false. Use -c with no\n                       argument to use the default compression options.   [string]\n    -d, --define       Global definitions                                 [string]\n    --comments         Preserve copyright comments in the output. By default this\n                       works like Google Closure, keeping JSDoc-style comments\n                       that contain \"@license\" or \"@preserve\". You can optionally\n                       pass one of the following arguments to this flag:\n                       - \"all\" to keep all comments\n                       - a valid JS regexp (needs to start with a slash) to keep\n                       only comments that match.\n                       Note that currently not *all* comments can be kept when\n                       compression is on, because of dead code removal or\n                       cascading statements into sequences.

You need to pass an\n                       argument to this option to specify the name that your\n                       module will take when included in, say, a browser.\n                                                                          [string]\n    --export-all       Only used when --wrap, this tells UglifyJS to add code to\n                       automatically export all globals.                 [boolean]\n    --lint             Display some scope warnings                       [boolean]\n    -v, --verbose      Verbose                                           [boolean]\n    -V, --version      Print version number and exit.                    [boolean]\n\nSpecify `--output` (`-o`) to declare the output file.  Otherwise the output\ngoes to STDOUT.\n\n## Source map options\n\nUglifyJS2 can generate a source map file, which is highly useful for\ndebugging your compressed JavaScript.  To get a source map, pass\n`--source-map output.js.map` (full path to the file where you want the\nsource map dumped).\n\nAdditionally you might need `--source-map-root` to pass the URL where the\noriginal files can be found.  In case you are passing full paths to input\nfiles to UglifyJS, you can use `--prefix` (`-p`) to specify the number of\ndirectories to drop from the path prefix when declaring files in the source\nmap.\n\nFor example:\n\n    uglifyjs /home/doe/work/foo/src/js/file1.js \\\n             /home/doe/work/foo/src/js/file2.js \\\n             -o foo.min.js \\\n             --source-map foo.min.js.map \\\n             --source-map-root http://foo.com/src \\\n             -p 5 -c -m\n\nThe above will compress and mangle `file1.js` and `file2.js`, will drop the\noutput in `foo.min.js` and the source map in `foo.min.js.map`.  The source\nmapping will refer to `http://foo.com/src/js/file1.js` and\n`http://foo.com/src/js/file2.js` (in fact it will list `http://foo.com/src`\nas the source map root, and the original files as `js/file1.js` and\n`js/file2.js`).\n\n### Composed source map\n\nWhen you're compressing JS code that was output by a compiler such as\nCoffeeScript, mapping to the JS code won't be too helpful.  Instead, you'd\nlike to map back to the original code (i.e. CoffeeScript).  UglifyJS has an\noption to take an input source map.  Assuming you have a mapping from\nCoffeeScript → compiled JS, UglifyJS can generate a map from CoffeeScript →\ncompressed JS by mapping every token in the compiled JS to its original\nlocation.\n\nTo use this feature you need to pass `--in-source-map\n/path/to/input/source.map`.  Normally the input source map should also point\nto the file containing the generated JS, so if that's correct you can omit\ninput files from the command line.\n\n## Mangler options\n\nTo enable the mangler you need to pass `--mangle` (`-m`).  The following\n(comma-separated) options are supported:\n\n- `sort` — to assign shorter names to most frequently used variables.  This\n  saves a few hundred bytes on jQuery before gzip, but the output is\n  _bigger_ after gzip (and seems to happen for other libraries I tried it\n  on) therefore it's not enabled by default.\n\n- `toplevel` — mangle names declared in the toplevel scope (disabled by\n  default).\n\n- `eval` — mangle names visible in scopes where `eval` or `when` are used\n  (disabled by default).\n\nWhen mangling is enabled but you want to prevent certain names from being\nmangled, you can declare those names with `--reserved` (`-r`) — pass a\ncomma-separated list of names.  For example:\n\n    uglifyjs ... -m -r '$,require,exports'\n\nto prevent the `require`, `exports` and `$` names from being changed.\n\n## Compressor options\n\nYou need to pass `--compress` (`-c`) to enable the compressor.  Optionally\nyou can pass a comma-separated list of options.  Options are in the form\n`foo=bar`, or just `foo` (the latter implies a boolean option that you want\nto set `true`; it's effectively a shortcut for `foo=true`).\n\n- `sequences` -- join consecutive simple statements using the comma operator\n- `properties` -- rewrite property access using the dot notation, for\n  example `foo[\"bar\"] → foo.bar`\n- `dead_code` -- remove unreachable code\n- `drop_debugger` -- remove `debugger;` statements\n- `unsafe` (default: false) -- apply \"unsafe\" transformations (discussion below)\n- `conditionals` -- apply optimizations for `if`-s and conditional\n  expressions\n- `comparisons` -- apply certain optimizations to binary nodes, for example:\n  `!(a <= b) → a > b` (only when `unsafe`), attempts to negate binary nodes,\n  e.g. `a = !b && !c && !d && !e → a=!(b||c||d||e)` etc.\n- `evaluate` -- attempt to evaluate constant expressions\n- `booleans` -- various optimizations for boolean context, for example `!!a\n  ? b : c → a ? b : c`\n- `loops` -- optimizations for `do`, `while` and `for` loops when we can\n  statically determine the condition\n- `unused` -- drop unreferenced functions and variables\n- `hoist_funs` -- hoist function declarations\n- `hoist_vars` (default: false) -- hoist `var` declarations (this is `false`\n  by default because it seems to increase the size of the output in general)\n- `if_return` -- optimizations for if/return and if/continue\n- `join_vars` -- join consecutive `var` statements\n- `cascade` -- small optimization for sequences, transform `x, x` into `x`\n  and `x = something(), x` into `x = something()`\n- `warnings` -- display warnings when dropping unreachable code or unused\n  declarations etc.\n\n### The `unsafe` option\n\nIt enables some transformations that *might* break code logic in certain\ncontrived cases, but should be fine for most code.  You might want to try it\non your own code, it should reduce the minified size.  Here's what happens\nwhen this flag is on:\n\n- `new Array(1, 2, 3)` or `Array(1, 2, 3)` → `[1, 2, 3 ]`\n- `new Object()` → `{}`\n- `String(exp)` or `exp.toString()` → `\"\" + exp`\n- `new Object/RegExp/Function/Error/Array (...)` → we discard the `new`\n- `typeof foo == \"undefined\"` → `foo === void 0`\n- `void 0` → `\"undefined\"` (if there is a variable named \"undefined\" in\n  scope; we do it because the variable name will be mangled, typically\n  reduced to a single character).\n\n### Conditional compilation\n\nYou can use the `--define` (`-d`) switch in order to declare global\nvariables that UglifyJS will assume to be constants (unless defined in\nscope).  For example if you pass `--define DEBUG=false` then, coupled with\ndead code removal UglifyJS will discard the following from the output:\n```javascript\nif (DEBUG) {\n\tconsole.log(\"debug stuff\");\n}\n```\n\nUglifyJS will warn about the condition being always false and about dropping\nunreachable code; for now there is no option to turn off only this specific\nwarning, you can pass `warnings=false` to turn off *all* warnings.\n\nAnother way of doing that is to declare your globals as constants in a\nseparate file and include it into the build.  For example you can have a\n`build/defines.js` file with the following:\n```javascript\nconst DEBUG = false;\nconst PRODUCTION = true;\n// etc.\n```\n\nand build your code like this:\n\n    uglifyjs build/defines.js js/foo.js js/bar.js... -c\n\nUglifyJS will notice the constants and, since they cannot be altered, it\nwill evaluate references to them to the value itself and drop unreachable\ncode as usual.  The possible downside of this approach is that the build\nwill contain the `const` declarations.\n\n<a name=\"codegen-options\"></a>\n## Beautifier options\n\nThe code generator tries to output shortest code possible by default.  In\ncase you want beautified output, pass `--beautify` (`-b`).  Optionally you\ncan pass additional arguments that control the code output:\n\n- `beautify` (default `true`) -- whether to actually beautify the output.\n  Passing `-b` will set this to true, but you might need to pass `-b` even\n  when you want to generate minified code, in order to specify additional\n  arguments, so you can use `-b beautify=false` to override it.\n- `indent-level` (default 4)\n- `indent-start` (default 0) -- prefix all lines by that many spaces\n- `quote-keys` (default `false`) -- pass `true` to quote all keys in literal\n  objects\n- `space-colon` (default `true`) -- insert a space after the colon signs\n- `ascii-only` (default `false`) -- escape Unicode characters in strings and\n  regexps\n- `inline-script` (default `false`) -- escape the slash in occurrences of\n  `</script` in strings\n- `width` (default 80) -- only takes effect when beautification is on, this\n  specifies an (orientative) line width that the beautifier will try to\n  obey.  It refers to the width of the line text (excluding indentation).\n  It doesn't work very well currently, but it does make the code generated\n  by UglifyJS more readable.\n- `max-line-len` (default 32000) -- maximum line length (for uglified code)\n- `ie-proof` (default `true`) -- generate “IE-proof” code (for now this\n  means add brackets around the do/while in code like this: `if (foo) do\n  something(); while (bar); else ...`.\n- `bracketize` (default `false`) -- always insert brackets in `if`, `for`,\n  `do`, `while` or `with` statements, even if their body is a single\n  statement.\n- `semicolons` (default `true`) -- separate statements with semicolons.  If\n  you pass `false` then whenever possible we will use a newline instead of a\n  semicolon, leading to more readable output of uglified code (size before\n  gzip could be smaller; size after gzip insignificantly larger).\n\n### Keeping copyright notices or other comments\n\nYou can pass `--comments` to retain certain comments in the output.  By\ndefault it will keep JSDoc-style comments that contain \"@preserve\",\n\"@license\" or \"@cc_on\" (conditional compilation for IE).  You can pass\n`--comments all` to keep all the comments, or a valid JavaScript regexp to\nkeep only comments that match this regexp.  For example `--comments\n'/foo|bar/'` will keep only comments that contain \"foo\" or \"bar\".\n\nNote, however, that there might be situations where comments are lost.  For\nexample:\n```javascript\nfunction f() {\n\t/** @preserve Foo Bar */\n\tfunction g() {\n\t  // this function is never called\n\t}\n\treturn something();\n}\n```\n\nEven though it has \"@preserve\", the comment will be lost because the inner\nfunction `g` (which is the AST node to which the comment is attached to) is\ndiscarded by the compressor as not referenced.\n\nThe safest comments where to place copyright information (or other info that\nneeds to be kept in the output) are comments attached to toplevel nodes.\n\n## Support for the SpiderMonkey AST\n\nUglifyJS2 has its own abstract syntax tree format; for\n[practical reasons](http://lisperator.net/blog/uglifyjs-why-not-switching-to-spidermonkey-ast/)\nwe can't easily change to using the SpiderMonkey AST internally.  However,\nUglifyJS now has a converter which can import a SpiderMonkey AST.\n\nFor example [Acorn][acorn] is a super-fast parser that produces a\nSpiderMonkey AST.  It has a small CLI utility that parses one file and dumps\nthe AST in JSON on the standard output.  To use UglifyJS to mangle and\ncompress that:\n\n    acorn file.js | uglifyjs --spidermonkey -m -c\n\nThe `--spidermonkey` option tells UglifyJS that all input files are not\nJavaScript, but JS code described in SpiderMonkey AST in JSON.  Therefore we\ndon't use our own parser in this case, but just transform that AST into our\ninternal AST.\n\n### Use Acorn for parsing\n\nMore for fun, I added the `--acorn` option which will use Acorn to do all\nthe parsing.  If you pass this option, UglifyJS will `require(\"acorn\")`.\n\nAcorn is really fast (e.g. 250ms instead of 380ms on some 650K code), but\nconverting the SpiderMonkey tree that Acorn produces takes another 150ms so\nin total it's a bit more than just using UglifyJS's own parser.\n\nAPI Reference\n-------------\n\nAssuming installation via NPM, you can load UglifyJS in your application\nlike this:\n```javascript\nvar UglifyJS = require(\"uglify-js\");\n```\n\nIt exports a lot of names, but I'll discuss here the basics that are needed\nfor parsing, mangling and compressing a piece of code.  The sequence is (1)\nparse, (2) compress, (3) mangle, (4) generate output code.\n\n### The simple way\n\nThere's a single toplevel function which combines all the steps.  If you\ndon't need additional customization, you might want to go with `minify`.\nExample:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify(\"/path/to/file.js\");\nconsole.log(result.code); // minified output\n// if you need to pass code instead of file name\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify(\"var b = function () {};\", {fromString: true});\n```\n\nYou can also compress multiple files:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ]);\nconsole.log(result.code);\n```\n\nTo generate a source map:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ], {\n\toutSourceMap: \"out.js.map\"\n});\nconsole.log(result.code); // minified output\nconsole.log(result.map);\n```\n\nNote that the source map is not saved in a file, it's just returned in\n`result.map`.  The value passed for `outSourceMap` is only used to set the\n`file` attribute in the source map (see [the spec][sm-spec]).\n\nYou can also specify sourceRoot property to be included in source map:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ], {\n\toutSourceMap: \"out.js.map\",\n\tsourceRoot: \"http://example.com/src\"\n});\n```\n\nIf you're compressing compiled JavaScript and have a source map for it, you\ncan use the `inSourceMap` argument:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify(\"compiled.js\", {\n\tinSourceMap: \"compiled.js.map\",\n\toutSourceMap: \"minified.js.map\"\n});\n// same as before, it returns `code` and `map`\n```\n\nThe `inSourceMap` is only used if you also request `outSourceMap` (it makes\nno sense otherwise).\n\nOther options:\n\n- `warnings` (default `false`) — pass `true` to display compressor warnings.\n\n- `fromString` (default `false`) — if you pass `true` then you can pass\n  JavaScript source code, rather than file names.\n\n- `mangle` — pass `false` to skip mangling names.\n\n- `output` (default `null`) — pass an object if you wish to specify\n  additional [output options][codegen].  The defaults are optimized\n  for best compression.\n\n- `compress` (default `{}`) — pass `false` to skip compressing entirely.\n  Pass an object to specify custom [compressor options][compressor].\n\nWe could add more options to `UglifyJS.minify` — if you need additional\nfunctionality please suggest!\n\n### The hard way\n\nFollowing there's more detailed API info, in case the `minify` function is\ntoo simple for your needs.\n\n#### The parser\n```javascript\nvar toplevel_ast = UglifyJS.parse(code, options);\n```\n\n`options` is optional and if present it must be an object.  The following\nproperties are available:\n\n- `strict` — disable automatic semicolon insertion and support for trailing\n  comma in arrays and objects\n- `filename` — the name of the file where this code is coming from\n- `toplevel` — a `toplevel` node (as returned by a previous invocation of\n  `parse`)\n\nThe last two options are useful when you'd like to minify multiple files and\nget a single file as the output and a proper source map.  Our CLI tool does\nsomething like this:\n```javascript\nvar toplevel = null;\nfiles.forEach(function(file){\n\tvar code = fs.readFileSync(file);\n\ttoplevel = UglifyJS.parse(code, {\n\t\tfilename: file,\n\t\ttoplevel: toplevel\n\t});\n});\n```\n\nAfter this, we have in `toplevel` a big AST containing all our files, with\neach token having proper information about where it came from.\n\n#### Scope information\n\nUglifyJS contains a scope analyzer that you need to call manually before\ncompressing or mangling.  Basically it augments various nodes in the AST\nwith information about where is a name defined, how many times is a name\nreferenced, if it is a global or not, if a function is using `eval` or the\n`with` statement etc.  I will discuss this some place else, for now what's\nimportant to know is that you need to call the following before doing\nanything with the tree:\n```javascript\ntoplevel.figure_out_scope()\n```\n\n#### Compression\n\nLike this:\n```javascript\nvar compressor = UglifyJS.Compressor(options);\nvar compressed_ast = toplevel.transform(compressor);\n```\n\nThe `options` can be missing.  Available options are discussed above in\n“Compressor options”.  Defaults should lead to best compression in most\nscripts.\n\nThe compressor is destructive, so don't rely that `toplevel` remains the\noriginal tree.\n\n#### Mangling\n\nAfter compression it is a good idea to call again `figure_out_scope` (since\nthe compressor might drop unused variables / unreachable code and this might\nchange the number of identifiers or their position).  Optionally, you can\ncall a trick that helps after Gzip (counting character frequency in\nnon-mangleable words).  Example:\n```javascript\ncompressed_ast.figure_out_scope();\ncompressed_ast.compute_char_frequency();\ncompressed_ast.mangle_names();\n```\n\n#### Generating output\n\nAST nodes have a `print` method that takes an output stream.  Essentially,\nto generate code you do this:\n```javascript\nvar stream = UglifyJS.OutputStream(options);\ncompressed_ast.print(stream);\nvar code = stream.toString(); // this is your minified code\n```\n\nor, for a shortcut you can do:\n```javascript\nvar code = compressed_ast.print_to_string(options);\n```\n\nAs usual, `options` is optional.  The output stream accepts a lot of otions,\nmost of them documented above in section “Beautifier options”.  The two\nwhich we care about here are `source_map` and `comments`.\n\n#### Keeping comments in the output\n\nIn order to keep certain comments in the output you need to pass the\n`comments` option.  Pass a RegExp or a function.  If you pass a RegExp, only\nthose comments whose body matches the regexp will be kept.  Note that body\nmeans without the initial `//` or `/*`.  If you pass a function, it will be\ncalled for every comment in the tree and will receive two arguments: the\nnode that the comment is attached to, and the comment token itself.\n\nThe comment token has these properties:\n\n- `type`: \"comment1\" for single-line comments or \"comment2\" for multi-line\n  comments\n- `value`: the comment body\n- `pos` and `endpos`: the start/end positions (zero-based indexes) in the\n  original code where this comment appears\n- `line` and `col`: the line and column where this comment appears in the\n  original code\n- `file` — the file name of the original file\n- `nlb` — true if there was a newline before this comment in the original\n  code, or if this comment contains a newline.\n\nYour function should return `true` to keep the comment, or a falsy value\notherwise.\n\n#### Generating a source mapping\n\nYou need to pass the `source_map` argument when calling `print`.  It needs\nto be a `SourceMap` object (which is a thin wrapper on top of the\n[source-map][source-map] library).\n\nExample:\n```javascript\nvar source_map = UglifyJS.SourceMap(source_map_options);\nvar stream = UglifyJS.OutputStream({\n\t...\n\tsource_map: source_map\n});\ncompressed_ast.print(stream);\n\nvar code = stream.toString();\nvar map = source_map.toString(); // json output for your source map\n```\n\nThe `source_map_options` (optional) can contain the following properties:\n\n- `file`: the name of the JavaScript output file that this mapping refers to\n- `root`: the `sourceRoot` property (see the [spec][sm-spec])\n- `orig`: the \"original source map\", handy when you compress generated JS\n  and want to map the minified output back to the original code where it\n  came from.  It can be simply a string in JSON, or a JSON object containing\n  the original source map.\n\n  [acorn]: https://github.com/marijnh/acorn\n  [source-map]: https://github.com/mozilla/source-map\n  [sm-spec]: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1RGAehQwRypUTovF1KRlpiOFze0b-_2gc6fAH0KY0k/edit\n  [codegen]: http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/codegen\n  [compressor]: http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/compress\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","_id":"uglify-js@2.3.5","dist":{"shasum":"3939907b4b4ec7a48a9775463bf43fed33216035","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/uglify-js/-/uglify-js-2.3.5.tgz"},"_from":".","_npmVersion":"1.2.18","_npmUser":{"name":"mishoo","email":"mihai.bazon@gmail.com"},"directories":{}},"2.3.6":{"name":"uglify-js","description":"JavaScript parser, mangler/compressor and beautifier toolkit","homepage":"http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs","main":"tools/node.js","version":"2.3.6","engines":{"node":">=0.4.0"},"maintainers":[{"name":"caires","email":"cairesvs@gmail.com"},{"name":"mape","email":"mape@mape.me"},{"name":"mishoo","email":"mihai.bazon@gmail.com"}],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2.git"},"dependencies":{"async":"~0.2.6","source-map":"~0.1.7","optimist":"~0.3.5"},"bin":{"uglifyjs":"bin/uglifyjs"},"scripts":{"test":"node test/run-tests.js"},"readme":"UglifyJS 2\n==========\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mishoo/UglifyJS2.png)](https://travis-ci.org/mishoo/UglifyJS2)\n\nUglifyJS is a JavaScript parser, minifier, compressor or beautifier toolkit.\n\nThis page documents the command line utility.

It's recommended that you pass the\ninput files first, then pass the options.  UglifyJS will parse input files\nin sequence and apply any compression options.  The files are parsed in the\nsame global scope, that is, a reference from a file to some\nvariable/function declared in another file will be matched properly.\n\nIf you want to read from STDIN instead, pass a single dash instead of input\nfiles.\n\nThe available options are:\n\n    --source-map       Specify an output file where to generate source map.\n                                                                          [string]\n    --source-map-root  The path to the original source to be included in the\n                       source map.                                        [string]\n    --source-map-url   The path to the source map to be added in //@\n                       sourceMappingURL.  Defaults to the value passed with\n                       --source-map.                                      [string]\n    --in-source-map    Input source map, useful if you're compressing JS that was\n                       generated from some other original code.\n    --screw-ie8        Pass this flag if you don't care about full compliance with\n                       Internet Explorer 6-8 quirks (by default UglifyJS will try\n                       to be IE-proof).\n    -p, --prefix       Skip prefix for original filenames that appear in source\n                       maps. For example -p 3 will drop 3 directories from file\n                       names and ensure they are relative paths.\n    -o, --output       Output file (default STDOUT).\n    -b, --beautify     Beautify output/specify output options.

Pass options\n                       like -c hoist_vars=false,if_return=false. Use -c with no\n                       argument to use the default compression options.   [string]\n    -d, --define       Global definitions                                 [string]\n    --comments         Preserve copyright comments in the output. By default this\n                       works like Google Closure, keeping JSDoc-style comments\n                       that contain \"@license\" or \"@preserve\". You can optionally\n                       pass one of the following arguments to this flag:\n                       - \"all\" to keep all comments\n                       - a valid JS regexp (needs to start with a slash) to keep\n                       only comments that match.\n                       Note that currently not *all* comments can be kept when\n                       compression is on, because of dead code removal or\n                       cascading statements into sequences.

[boolean]\n    --spidermonkey     Assume input files are SpiderMonkey AST format (as JSON).\n                                                                         [boolean]\n    --self             Build itself (UglifyJS2) as a library (implies\n                       --wrap=UglifyJS --export-all)                     [boolean]\n    --wrap             Embed everything in a big function, making the “exports”\n                       and “global” variables available. You need to pass an\n                       argument to this option to specify the name that your\n                       module will take when included in, say, a browser.\n                                                                          [string]\n    --export-all       Only used when --wrap, this tells UglifyJS to add code to\n                       automatically export all globals.                 [boolean]\n    --lint             Display some scope warnings                       [boolean]\n    -v, --verbose      Verbose                                           [boolean]\n    -V, --version      Print version number and exit.                    [boolean]\n\nSpecify `--output` (`-o`) to declare the output file.  Otherwise the output\ngoes to STDOUT.\n\n## Source map options\n\nUglifyJS2 can generate a source map file, which is highly useful for\ndebugging your compressed JavaScript.  To get a source map, pass\n`--source-map output.js.map` (full path to the file where you want the\nsource map dumped).\n\nAdditionally you might need `--source-map-root` to pass the URL where the\noriginal files can be found.  In case you are passing full paths to input\nfiles to UglifyJS, you can use `--prefix` (`-p`) to specify the number of\ndirectories to drop from the path prefix when declaring files in the source\nmap.\n\nFor example:\n\n    uglifyjs /home/doe/work/foo/src/js/file1.js \\\n             /home/doe/work/foo/src/js/file2.js \\\n             -o foo.min.js \\\n             --source-map foo.min.js.map \\\n             --source-map-root http://foo.com/src \\\n             -p 5 -c -m\n\nThe above will compress and mangle `file1.js` and `file2.js`, will drop the\noutput in `foo.min.js` and the source map in `foo.min.js.map`.  The source\nmapping will refer to `http://foo.com/src/js/file1.js` and\n`http://foo.com/src/js/file2.js` (in fact it will list `http://foo.com/src`\nas the source map root, and the original files as `js/file1.js` and\n`js/file2.js`).\n\n### Composed source map\n\nWhen you're compressing JS code that was output by a compiler such as\nCoffeeScript, mapping to the JS code won't be too helpful.  Instead, you'd\nlike to map back to the original code (i.e. CoffeeScript).  UglifyJS has an\noption to take an input source map.  Assuming you have a mapping from\nCoffeeScript → compiled JS, UglifyJS can generate a map from CoffeeScript →\ncompressed JS by mapping every token in the compiled JS to its original\nlocation.\n\nTo use this feature you need to pass `--in-source-map\n/path/to/input/source.map`.  Normally the input source map should also point\nto the file containing the generated JS, so if that's correct you can omit\ninput files from the command line.\n\n## Mangler options\n\nTo enable the mangler you need to pass `--mangle` (`-m`).  The following\n(comma-separated) options are supported:\n\n- `sort` — to assign shorter names to most frequently used variables.  This\n  saves a few hundred bytes on jQuery before gzip, but the output is\n  _bigger_ after gzip (and seems to happen for other libraries I tried it\n  on) therefore it's not enabled by default.\n\n- `toplevel` — mangle names declared in the toplevel scope (disabled by\n  default).\n\n- `eval` — mangle names visible in scopes where `eval` or `when` are used\n  (disabled by default).\n\nWhen mangling is enabled but you want to prevent certain names from being\nmangled, you can declare those names with `--reserved` (`-r`) — pass a\ncomma-separated list of names.  For example:\n\n    uglifyjs ... -m -r '$,require,exports'\n\nto prevent the `require`, `exports` and `$` names from being changed.\n\n## Compressor options\n\nYou need to pass `--compress` (`-c`) to enable the compressor.  Optionally\nyou can pass a comma-separated list of options.  Options are in the form\n`foo=bar`, or just `foo` (the latter implies a boolean option that you want\nto set `true`; it's effectively a shortcut for `foo=true`).\n\n- `sequences` -- join consecutive simple statements using the comma operator\n- `properties` -- rewrite property access using the dot notation, for\n  example `foo[\"bar\"] → foo.bar`\n- `dead_code` -- remove unreachable code\n- `drop_debugger` -- remove `debugger;` statements\n- `unsafe` (default: false) -- apply \"unsafe\" transformations (discussion below)\n- `conditionals` -- apply optimizations for `if`-s and conditional\n  expressions\n- `comparisons` -- apply certain optimizations to binary nodes, for example:\n  `!(a <= b) → a > b` (only when `unsafe`), attempts to negate binary nodes,\n  e.g. `a = !b && !c && !d && !e → a=!(b||c||d||e)` etc.\n- `evaluate` -- attempt to evaluate constant expressions\n- `booleans` -- various optimizations for boolean context, for example `!!a\n  ? b : c → a ? b : c`\n- `loops` -- optimizations for `do`, `while` and `for` loops when we can\n  statically determine the condition\n- `unused` -- drop unreferenced functions and variables\n- `hoist_funs` -- hoist function declarations\n- `hoist_vars` (default: false) -- hoist `var` declarations (this is `false`\n  by default because it seems to increase the size of the output in general)\n- `if_return` -- optimizations for if/return and if/continue\n- `join_vars` -- join consecutive `var` statements\n- `cascade` -- small optimization for sequences, transform `x, x` into `x`\n  and `x = something(), x` into `x = something()`\n- `warnings` -- display warnings when dropping unreachable code or unused\n  declarations etc.\n\n### The `unsafe` option\n\nIt enables some transformations that *might* break code logic in certain\ncontrived cases, but should be fine for most code.  You might want to try it\non your own code, it should reduce the minified size.  Here's what happens\nwhen this flag is on:\n\n- `new Array(1, 2, 3)` or `Array(1, 2, 3)` → `[1, 2, 3 ]`\n- `new Object()` → `{}`\n- `String(exp)` or `exp.toString()` → `\"\" + exp`\n- `new Object/RegExp/Function/Error/Array (...)` → we discard the `new`\n- `typeof foo == \"undefined\"` → `foo === void 0`\n- `void 0` → `\"undefined\"` (if there is a variable named \"undefined\" in\n  scope; we do it because the variable name will be mangled, typically\n  reduced to a single character).\n\n### Conditional compilation\n\nYou can use the `--define` (`-d`) switch in order to declare global\nvariables that UglifyJS will assume to be constants (unless defined in\nscope).  For example if you pass `--define DEBUG=false` then, coupled with\ndead code removal UglifyJS will discard the following from the output:\n```javascript\nif (DEBUG) {\n\tconsole.log(\"debug stuff\");\n}\n```\n\nUglifyJS will warn about the condition being always false and about dropping\nunreachable code; for now there is no option to turn off only this specific\nwarning, you can pass `warnings=false` to turn off *all* warnings.\n\nAnother way of doing that is to declare your globals as constants in a\nseparate file and include it into the build.  For example you can have a\n`build/defines.js` file with the following:\n```javascript\nconst DEBUG = false;\nconst PRODUCTION = true;\n// etc.\n```\n\nand build your code like this:\n\n    uglifyjs build/defines.js js/foo.js js/bar.js... -c\n\nUglifyJS will notice the constants and, since they cannot be altered, it\nwill evaluate references to them to the value itself and drop unreachable\ncode as usual.  The possible downside of this approach is that the build\nwill contain the `const` declarations.\n\n<a name=\"codegen-options\"></a>\n## Beautifier options\n\nThe code generator tries to output shortest code possible by default.  In\ncase you want beautified output, pass `--beautify` (`-b`).  Optionally you\ncan pass additional arguments that control the code output:\n\n- `beautify` (default `true`) -- whether to actually beautify the output.\n  Passing `-b` will set this to true, but you might need to pass `-b` even\n  when you want to generate minified code, in order to specify additional\n  arguments, so you can use `-b beautify=false` to override it.\n- `indent-level` (default 4)\n- `indent-start` (default 0) -- prefix all lines by that many spaces\n- `quote-keys` (default `false`) -- pass `true` to quote all keys in literal\n  objects\n- `space-colon` (default `true`) -- insert a space after the colon signs\n- `ascii-only` (default `false`) -- escape Unicode characters in strings and\n  regexps\n- `inline-script` (default `false`) -- escape the slash in occurrences of\n  `</script` in strings\n- `width` (default 80) -- only takes effect when beautification is on, this\n  specifies an (orientative) line width that the beautifier will try to\n  obey.  It refers to the width of the line text (excluding indentation).\n  It doesn't work very well currently, but it does make the code generated\n  by UglifyJS more readable.\n- `max-line-len` (default 32000) -- maximum line length (for uglified code)\n- `ie-proof` (default `true`) -- generate “IE-proof” code (for now this\n  means add brackets around the do/while in code like this: `if (foo) do\n  something(); while (bar); else ...`.\n- `bracketize` (default `false`) -- always insert brackets in `if`, `for`,\n  `do`, `while` or `with` statements, even if their body is a single\n  statement.\n- `semicolons` (default `true`) -- separate statements with semicolons.  If\n  you pass `false` then whenever possible we will use a newline instead of a\n  semicolon, leading to more readable output of uglified code (size before\n  gzip could be smaller; size after gzip insignificantly larger).\n- `negate-iife` (default `!beautify`) -- prefer negation, rather than\n  parens, for \"Immediately-Called Function Expressions\".  This defaults to\n  `true` when beautification is off, and `false` if beautification is on;\n  pass it manually to force a value.\n\n### Keeping copyright notices or other comments\n\nYou can pass `--comments` to retain certain comments in the output.  By\ndefault it will keep JSDoc-style comments that contain \"@preserve\",\n\"@license\" or \"@cc_on\" (conditional compilation for IE).  You can pass\n`--comments all` to keep all the comments, or a valid JavaScript regexp to\nkeep only comments that match this regexp.  For example `--comments\n'/foo|bar/'` will keep only comments that contain \"foo\" or \"bar\".\n\nNote, however, that there might be situations where comments are lost.  For\nexample:\n```javascript\nfunction f() {\n\t/** @preserve Foo Bar */\n\tfunction g() {\n\t  // this function is never called\n\t}\n\treturn something();\n}\n```\n\nEven though it has \"@preserve\", the comment will be lost because the inner\nfunction `g` (which is the AST node to which the comment is attached to) is\ndiscarded by the compressor as not referenced.\n\nThe safest comments where to place copyright information (or other info that\nneeds to be kept in the output) are comments attached to toplevel nodes.\n\n## Support for the SpiderMonkey AST\n\nUglifyJS2 has its own abstract syntax tree format; for\n[practical reasons](http://lisperator.net/blog/uglifyjs-why-not-switching-to-spidermonkey-ast/)\nwe can't easily change to using the SpiderMonkey AST internally.  However,\nUglifyJS now has a converter which can import a SpiderMonkey AST.\n\nFor example [Acorn][acorn] is a super-fast parser that produces a\nSpiderMonkey AST.  It has a small CLI utility that parses one file and dumps\nthe AST in JSON on the standard output.  To use UglifyJS to mangle and\ncompress that:\n\n    acorn file.js | uglifyjs --spidermonkey -m -c\n\nThe `--spidermonkey` option tells UglifyJS that all input files are not\nJavaScript, but JS code described in SpiderMonkey AST in JSON.  Therefore we\ndon't use our own parser in this case, but just transform that AST into our\ninternal AST.\n\n### Use Acorn for parsing\n\nMore for fun, I added the `--acorn` option which will use Acorn to do all\nthe parsing.  If you pass this option, UglifyJS will `require(\"acorn\")`.\n\nAcorn is really fast (e.g. 250ms instead of 380ms on some 650K code), but\nconverting the SpiderMonkey tree that Acorn produces takes another 150ms so\nin total it's a bit more than just using UglifyJS's own parser.\n\nAPI Reference\n-------------\n\nAssuming installation via NPM, you can load UglifyJS in your application\nlike this:\n```javascript\nvar UglifyJS = require(\"uglify-js\");\n```\n\nIt exports a lot of names, but I'll discuss here the basics that are needed\nfor parsing, mangling and compressing a piece of code.  The sequence is (1)\nparse, (2) compress, (3) mangle, (4) generate output code.\n\n### The simple way\n\nThere's a single toplevel function which combines all the steps.  If you\ndon't need additional customization, you might want to go with `minify`.\nExample:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify(\"/path/to/file.js\");\nconsole.log(result.code); // minified output\n// if you need to pass code instead of file name\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify(\"var b = function () {};\", {fromString: true});\n```\n\nYou can also compress multiple files:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ]);\nconsole.log(result.code);\n```\n\nTo generate a source map:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ], {\n\toutSourceMap: \"out.js.map\"\n});\nconsole.log(result.code); // minified output\nconsole.log(result.map);\n```\n\nNote that the source map is not saved in a file, it's just returned in\n`result.map`.  The value passed for `outSourceMap` is only used to set the\n`file` attribute in the source map (see [the spec][sm-spec]).\n\nYou can also specify sourceRoot property to be included in source map:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ], {\n\toutSourceMap: \"out.js.map\",\n\tsourceRoot: \"http://example.com/src\"\n});\n```\n\nIf you're compressing compiled JavaScript and have a source map for it, you\ncan use the `inSourceMap` argument:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify(\"compiled.js\", {\n\tinSourceMap: \"compiled.js.map\",\n\toutSourceMap: \"minified.js.map\"\n});\n// same as before, it returns `code` and `map`\n```\n\nThe `inSourceMap` is only used if you also request `outSourceMap` (it makes\nno sense otherwise).\n\nOther options:\n\n- `warnings` (default `false`) — pass `true` to display compressor warnings.\n\n- `fromString` (default `false`) — if you pass `true` then you can pass\n  JavaScript source code, rather than file names.\n\n- `mangle` — pass `false` to skip mangling names.\n\n- `output` (default `null`) — pass an object if you wish to specify\n  additional [output options][codegen].  The defaults are optimized\n  for best compression.\n\n- `compress` (default `{}`) — pass `false` to skip compressing entirely.\n  Pass an object to specify custom [compressor options][compressor].\n\nWe could add more options to `UglifyJS.minify` — if you need additional\nfunctionality please suggest!\n\n### The hard way\n\nFollowing there's more detailed API info, in case the `minify` function is\ntoo simple for your needs.\n\n#### The parser\n```javascript\nvar toplevel_ast = UglifyJS.parse(code, options);\n```\n\n`options` is optional and if present it must be an object.  The following\nproperties are available:\n\n- `strict` — disable automatic semicolon insertion and support for trailing\n  comma in arrays and objects\n- `filename` — the name of the file where this code is coming from\n- `toplevel` — a `toplevel` node (as returned by a previous invocation of\n  `parse`)\n\nThe last two options are useful when you'd like to minify multiple files and\nget a single file as the output and a proper source map.  Our CLI tool does\nsomething like this:\n```javascript\nvar toplevel = null;\nfiles.forEach(function(file){\n\tvar code = fs.readFileSync(file);\n\ttoplevel = UglifyJS.parse(code, {\n\t\tfilename: file,\n\t\ttoplevel: toplevel\n\t});\n});\n```\n\nAfter this, we have in `toplevel` a big AST containing all our files, with\neach token having proper information about where it came from.\n\n#### Scope information\n\nUglifyJS contains a scope analyzer that you need to call manually before\ncompressing or mangling.  Basically it augments various nodes in the AST\nwith information about where is a name defined, how many times is a name\nreferenced, if it is a global or not, if a function is using `eval` or the\n`with` statement etc.  I will discuss this some place else, for now what's\nimportant to know is that you need to call the following before doing\nanything with the tree:\n```javascript\ntoplevel.figure_out_scope()\n```\n\n#### Compression\n\nLike this:\n```javascript\nvar compressor = UglifyJS.Compressor(options);\nvar compressed_ast = toplevel.transform(compressor);\n```\n\nThe `options` can be missing.  Available options are discussed above in\n“Compressor options”.  Defaults should lead to best compression in most\nscripts.\n\nThe compressor is destructive, so don't rely that `toplevel` remains the\noriginal tree.\n\n#### Mangling\n\nAfter compression it is a good idea to call again `figure_out_scope` (since\nthe compressor might drop unused variables / unreachable code and this might\nchange the number of identifiers or their position).  Optionally, you can\ncall a trick that helps after Gzip (counting character frequency in\nnon-mangleable words).  Example:\n```javascript\ncompressed_ast.figure_out_scope();\ncompressed_ast.compute_char_frequency();\ncompressed_ast.mangle_names();\n```\n\n#### Generating output\n\nAST nodes have a `print` method that takes an output stream.  Essentially,\nto generate code you do this:\n```javascript\nvar stream = UglifyJS.OutputStream(options);\ncompressed_ast.print(stream);\nvar code = stream.toString(); // this is your minified code\n```\n\nor, for a shortcut you can do:\n```javascript\nvar code = compressed_ast.print_to_string(options);\n```\n\nAs usual, `options` is optional.  The output stream accepts a lot of otions,\nmost of them documented above in section “Beautifier options”.  The two\nwhich we care about here are `source_map` and `comments`.\n\n#### Keeping comments in the output\n\nIn order to keep certain comments in the output you need to pass the\n`comments` option.  Pass a RegExp or a function.  If you pass a RegExp, only\nthose comments whose body matches the regexp will be kept.  Note that body\nmeans without the initial `//` or `/*`.  If you pass a function, it will be\ncalled for every comment in the tree and will receive two arguments: the\nnode that the comment is attached to, and the comment token itself.\n\nThe comment token has these properties:\n\n- `type`: \"comment1\" for single-line comments or \"comment2\" for multi-line\n  comments\n- `value`: the comment body\n- `pos` and `endpos`: the start/end positions (zero-based indexes) in the\n  original code where this comment appears\n- `line` and `col`: the line and column where this comment appears in the\n  original code\n- `file` — the file name of the original file\n- `nlb` — true if there was a newline before this comment in the original\n  code, or if this comment contains a newline.\n\nYour function should return `true` to keep the comment, or a falsy value\notherwise.\n\n#### Generating a source mapping\n\nYou need to pass the `source_map` argument when calling `print`.  It needs\nto be a `SourceMap` object (which is a thin wrapper on top of the\n[source-map][source-map] library).\n\nExample:\n```javascript\nvar source_map = UglifyJS.SourceMap(source_map_options);\nvar stream = UglifyJS.OutputStream({\n\t...\n\tsource_map: source_map\n});\ncompressed_ast.print(stream);\n\nvar code = stream.toString();\nvar map = source_map.toString(); // json output for your source map\n```\n\nThe `source_map_options` (optional) can contain the following properties:\n\n- `file`: the name of the JavaScript output file that this mapping refers to\n- `root`: the `sourceRoot` property (see the [spec][sm-spec])\n- `orig`: the \"original source map\", handy when you compress generated JS\n  and want to map the minified output back to the original code where it\n  came from.  It can be simply a string in JSON, or a JSON object containing\n  the original source map.\n\n  [acorn]: https://github.com/marijnh/acorn\n  [source-map]: https://github.com/mozilla/source-map\n  [sm-spec]: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1RGAehQwRypUTovF1KRlpiOFze0b-_2gc6fAH0KY0k/edit\n  [codegen]: http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/codegen\n  [compressor]: http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/compress\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","_id":"uglify-js@2.3.6","dist":{"shasum":"fa0984770b428b7a9b2a8058f46355d14fef211a","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/uglify-js/-/uglify-js-2.3.6.tgz"},"_from":".","_npmVersion":"1.2.18","_npmUser":{"name":"mishoo","email":"mihai.bazon@gmail.com"},"directories":{}},"1.3.5":{"name":"uglify-js","description":"JavaScript parser and compressor/beautifier toolkit","author":{"name":"Mihai Bazon","email":"mihai.bazon@gmail.com","url":"http://mihai.bazon.net/blog"},"version":"1.3.5","main":"./uglify-js.js","bin":{"uglifyjs":"./bin/uglifyjs"},"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git@github.com:mishoo/UglifyJS.git"},"devDependencies":{"nodeunit":"0.7.x"},"scripts":{"test":"$(which nodeunit || echo node_modules/nodeunit/bin/nodeunit) test/unit/scripts.js && test/testparser.js && test/testconsolidator.js"},"readme":"<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\"\n               \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n<html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"\nlang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n<title>UglifyJS &ndash;

It is developed on <a href=\"http://nodejs.org/\">NodeJS</a>, but it\nshould work on any JavaScript platform supporting the CommonJS module system\n(and if your platform of choice doesn't support CommonJS, you can easily\nimplement it, or discard the <code>exports.*</code> lines from UglifyJS sources).\n</p>\n<p>\nThe tokenizer/parser generates an abstract syntax tree from JS code.  You\ncan then traverse the AST to learn more about the code, or do various\nmanipulations on it.  This part is implemented in <a href=\"../lib/parse-js.js\">parse-js.js</a> and it's a\nport to JavaScript of the excellent <a href=\"http://marijn.haverbeke.nl/parse-js/\">parse-js</a> Common Lisp library from <a href=\"http://marijn.haverbeke.nl/\">Marijn Haverbeke</a>.\n</p>\n<p>\n( See <a href=\"http://github.com/mishoo/cl-uglify-js\">cl-uglify-js</a> if you're looking for the Common Lisp version of\nUglifyJS. )\n</p>\n<p>\nThe second part of this package, implemented in <a href=\"../lib/process.js\">process.js</a>, inspects and\nmanipulates the AST generated by the parser to provide the following:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ability to re-generate JavaScript code from the AST.  Optionally\n  indented&mdash;you can use this if you want to “beautify” a program that has\n  been compressed, so that you can inspect the source.  But you can also run\n  our code generator to print out an AST without any whitespace, so you\n  achieve compression as well.\n\n</li>\n<li>shorten variable names (usually to single characters).  Our mangler will\n  analyze the code and generate proper variable names, depending on scope\n  and usage, and is smart enough to deal with globals defined elsewhere, or\n  with <code>eval()</code> calls or <code>with{}</code> statements.  In short, if <code>eval()</code> or\n  <code>with{}</code> are used in some scope, then all variables in that scope and any\n  variables in the parent scopes will remain unmangled, and any references\n  to such variables remain unmangled as well.\n\n</li>\n<li>various small optimizations that may lead to faster code but certainly\n  lead to smaller code.  Where possible, we do the following:\n\n<ul>\n<li>foo[\"bar\"]  ==&gt;  foo.bar\n\n</li>\n<li>remove block brackets <code>{}</code>\n\n</li>\n<li>join consecutive var declarations:\n    var a = 10; var b = 20; ==&gt; var a=10,b=20;\n\n</li>\n<li>resolve simple constant expressions: 1 +2 * 3 ==&gt; 7.  We only do the\n    replacement if the result occupies less bytes; for example 1/3 would\n    translate to 0.333333333333, so in this case we don't replace it.\n\n</li>\n<li>consecutive statements in blocks are merged into a sequence; in many\n    cases, this leaves blocks with a single statement, so then we can remove\n    the block brackets.\n\n</li>\n<li>various optimizations for IF statements:\n\n<ul>\n<li>if (foo) bar(); else baz(); ==&gt; foo?bar():baz();\n</li>\n<li>if (!foo) bar(); else baz(); ==&gt; foo?baz():bar();\n</li>\n<li>if (foo) bar(); ==&gt; foo&amp;&amp;bar();\n</li>\n<li>if (!foo) bar(); ==&gt; foo||bar();\n</li>\n<li>if (foo) return bar(); else return baz(); ==&gt; return foo?bar():baz();\n</li>\n<li>if (foo) return bar(); else something(); ==&gt; {if(foo)return bar();something()}\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n</li>\n<li>remove some unreachable code and warn about it (code that follows a\n    <code>return</code>, <code>throw</code>, <code>break</code> or <code>continue</code> statement, except\n    function/variable declarations).\n\n</li>\n<li>act a limited version of a pre-processor (c.f. the pre-processor of\n    C/C++) to allow you to safely replace selected global symbols with\n    specified values.  When combined with the optimisations above this can\n    make UglifyJS operate slightly more like a compilation process, in\n    that when certain symbols are replaced by constant values, entire code\n    blocks may be optimised away as unreachable.\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"outline-container-2-1\" class=\"outline-3\">\n<h3 id=\"sec-2-1\"><span class=\"section-number-3\">2.1</span> <span class=\"target\">Unsafe transformations</span>  </h3>\n<div class=\"outline-text-3\" id=\"text-2-1\">\n\n\n<p>\nThe following transformations can in theory break code, although they're\nprobably safe in most practical cases.

Known as aliasing in the Closure Compiler. Worsens the\n  data compression ratio of gzip.\n\n</li>\n<li><code>--ascii</code> &mdash; pass this argument to encode non-ASCII characters as\n  <code>\\uXXXX</code> sequences.  By default UglifyJS won't bother to do it and will\n  output Unicode characters instead.  (the output is always encoded in UTF8,\n  but if you pass this option you'll only get ASCII).\n\n</li>\n<li><code>-nm</code> or <code>--no-mangle</code> &mdash; don't mangle names.\n\n</li>\n<li><code>-nmf</code> or <code>--no-mangle-functions</code> &ndash; in case you want to mangle variable\n  names, but not touch function names.\n\n</li>\n<li><code>-ns</code> or <code>--no-squeeze</code> &mdash; don't call <code>ast_squeeze()</code> (which does various\n  optimizations that result in smaller, less readable code).\n\n</li>\n<li><code>-mt</code> or <code>--mangle-toplevel</code> &mdash; mangle names in the toplevel scope too\n  (by default we don't do this).\n\n</li>\n<li><code>--no-seqs</code> &mdash; when <code>ast_squeeze()</code> is called (thus, unless you pass\n  <code>--no-squeeze</code>) it will reduce consecutive statements in blocks into a\n  sequence.  For example, \"a = 10; b = 20; foo();\" will be written as\n  \"a=10,b=20,foo();\".  In various occasions, this allows us to discard the\n  block brackets (since the block becomes a single statement).  This is ON\n  by default because it seems safe and saves a few hundred bytes on some\n  libs that I tested it on, but pass <code>--no-seqs</code> to disable it.\n\n</li>\n<li><code>--no-dead-code</code> &mdash; by default, UglifyJS will remove code that is\n  obviously unreachable (code that follows a <code>return</code>, <code>throw</code>, <code>break</code> or\n  <code>continue</code> statement and is not a function/variable declaration).  Pass\n  this option to disable this optimization.\n\n</li>\n<li><code>-nc</code> or <code>--no-copyright</code> &mdash; by default, <code>uglifyjs</code> will keep the initial\n  comment tokens in the generated code (assumed to be copyright information\n  etc.).  If you pass this it will discard it.\n\n</li>\n<li><code>-o filename</code> or <code>--output filename</code> &mdash; put the result in <code>filename</code>.  If\n  this isn't given, the result goes to standard output (or see next one).\n\n</li>\n<li><code>--overwrite</code> &mdash; if the code is read from a file (not from STDIN) and you\n  pass <code>--overwrite</code> then the output will be written in the same file.\n\n</li>\n<li><code>--ast</code> &mdash; pass this if you want to get the Abstract Syntax Tree instead\n  of JavaScript as output.  Useful for debugging or learning more about the\n  internals.\n\n</li>\n<li><code>-v</code> or <code>--verbose</code> &mdash; output some notes on STDERR (for now just how long\n  each operation takes).\n\n</li>\n<li><code>-d SYMBOL[=VALUE]</code> or <code>--define SYMBOL[=VALUE]</code> &mdash; will replace\n  all instances of the specified symbol where used as an identifier\n  (except where symbol has properly declared by a var declaration or\n  use as function parameter or similar) with the specified value. This\n  argument may be specified multiple times to define multiple\n  symbols - if no value is specified the symbol will be replaced with\n  the value <code>true</code>, or you can specify a numeric value (such as\n  <code>1024</code>), a quoted string value (such as =\"object\"= or\n  ='https://github.com'<code>), or the name of another symbol or keyword   (such as =null</code> or <code>document</code>).\n  This allows you, for example, to assign meaningful names to key\n  constant values but discard the symbolic names in the uglified\n  version for brevity/efficiency, or when used wth care, allows\n  UglifyJS to operate as a form of <b>conditional compilation</b>\n  whereby defining appropriate values may, by dint of the constant\n  folding and dead code removal features above, remove entire\n  superfluous code blocks (e.g. completely remove instrumentation or\n  trace code for production use).\n  Where string values are being defined, the handling of quotes are\n  likely to be subject to the specifics of your command shell\n  environment, so you may need to experiment with quoting styles\n  depending on your platform, or you may find the option\n  <code>--define-from-module</code> more suitable for use.\n\n</li>\n<li><code>-define-from-module SOMEMODULE</code> &mdash; will load the named module (as\n  per the NodeJS <code>require()</code> function) and iterate all the exported\n  properties of the module defining them as symbol names to be defined\n  (as if by the <code>--define</code> option) per the name of each property\n  (i.e. without the module name prefix) and given the value of the\n  property. This is a much easier way to handle and document groups of\n  symbols to be defined rather than a large number of <code>--define</code>\n  options.\n\n</li>\n<li><code>--unsafe</code> &mdash; enable other additional optimizations that are known to be\n  unsafe in some contrived situations, but could still be generally useful.\n  For now only these:\n\n<ul>\n<li>foo.toString()  ==&gt;  foo+\"\"\n</li>\n<li>new Array(x,&hellip;)  ==&gt; [x,&hellip;]\n</li>\n<li>new Array(x) ==&gt; Array(x)\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n</li>\n<li><code>--max-line-len</code> (default 32K characters) &mdash; add a newline after around\n  32K characters.  I've seen both FF and Chrome croak when all the code was\n  on a single line of around 670K.  Pass &ndash;max-line-len 0 to disable this\n  safety feature.\n\n</li>\n<li><code>--reserved-names</code> &mdash; some libraries rely on certain names to be used, as\n  pointed out in issue #92 and #81, so this option allow you to exclude such\n  names from the mangler.  For example, to keep names <code>require</code> and <code>$super</code>\n  intact you'd specify &ndash;reserved-names \"require,$super\".\n\n</li>\n<li><code>--inline-script</code> &ndash; when you want to include the output literally in an\n  HTML <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag you can use this option to prevent <code>&lt;/script</code> from\n  showing up in the output.\n\n</li>\n<li><code>--lift-vars</code> &ndash; when you pass this, UglifyJS will apply the following\n  transformations (see the notes in API, <code>ast_lift_variables</code>):\n\n<ul>\n<li>put all <code>var</code> declarations at the start of the scope\n</li>\n<li>make sure a variable is declared only once\n</li>\n<li>discard unused function arguments\n</li>\n<li>discard unused inner (named) functions\n</li>\n<li>finally, try to merge assignments into that one <code>var</code> declaration, if\n    possible.\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"outline-container-2-4-1\" class=\"outline-4\">\n<h4 id=\"sec-2-4-1\"><span class=\"section-number-4\">2.4.1</span> API </h4>\n<div class=\"outline-text-4\" id=\"text-2-4-1\">\n\n\n<p>\nTo use the library from JavaScript, you'd do the following (example for\nNodeJS):\n</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"src src-js\"><span class=\"org-keyword\">var</span> <span class=\"org-variable-name\">jsp</span> = require(<span class=\"org-string\">\"uglify-js\"</span>).parser;\n<span class=\"org-keyword\">var</span> <span class=\"org-variable-name\">pro</span> = require(<span class=\"org-string\">\"uglify-js\"</span>).uglify;\n\n<span class=\"org-keyword\">var</span> <span class=\"org-variable-name\">orig_code</span> = <span class=\"org-string\">\"...

As you\ncan see, there are a sequence of steps which you can apply.  For example if\nyou want compressed output but for some reason you don't want to mangle\nvariable names, you would simply skip the line that calls\n<code>pro.ast_mangle(ast)</code>.\n</p>\n<p>\nSome of these functions take optional arguments.  Here's a description:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>jsp.parse(code, strict_semicolons)</code> &ndash; parses JS code and returns an AST.\n  <code>strict_semicolons</code> is optional and defaults to <code>false</code>.  If you pass\n  <code>true</code> then the parser will throw an error when it expects a semicolon and\n  it doesn't find it.  For most JS code you don't want that, but it's useful\n  if you want to strictly sanitize your code.\n\n</li>\n<li><code>pro.ast_lift_variables(ast)</code> &ndash; merge and move <code>var</code> declarations to the\n  scop of the scope; discard unused function arguments or variables; discard\n  unused (named) inner functions.  It also tries to merge assignments\n  following the <code>var</code> declaration into it.\n\n<p>\n  If your code is very hand-optimized concerning <code>var</code> declarations, this\n  lifting variable declarations might actually increase size.  For me it\n  helps out.  On jQuery it adds 865 bytes (243 after gzip).  YMMV.  Also\n  note that (since it's not enabled by default) this operation isn't yet\n  heavily tested (please report if you find issues!).\n</p>\n<p>\n  Note that although it might increase the image size (on jQuery it gains\n  865 bytes, 243 after gzip) it's technically more correct: in certain\n  situations, dead code removal might drop variable declarations, which\n  would not happen if the variables are lifted in advance.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Here's an example of what it does:\n</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"src src-js\"><span class=\"org-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"org-function-name\">f</span>(<span class=\"org-variable-name\">a</span>, <span class=\"org-variable-name\">b</span>, <span class=\"org-variable-name\">c</span>, <span class=\"org-variable-name\">d</span>, <span class=\"org-variable-name\">e</span>) {\n    <span class=\"org-keyword\">var</span> <span class=\"org-variable-name\">q</span>;\n    <span class=\"org-keyword\">var</span> <span class=\"org-variable-name\">w</span>;\n    w = 10;\n    q = 20;\n    <span class=\"org-keyword\">for</span> (<span class=\"org-keyword\">var</span> <span class=\"org-variable-name\">i</span> = 1; i &lt; 10; ++i) {\n        <span class=\"org-keyword\">var</span> <span class=\"org-variable-name\">boo</span> = foo(a);\n    }\n    <span class=\"org-keyword\">for</span> (<span class=\"org-keyword\">var</span> <span class=\"org-variable-name\">i</span> = 0; i &lt; 1; ++i) {\n        <span class=\"org-keyword\">var</span> <span class=\"org-variable-name\">boo</span> = bar(c);\n    }\n    <span class=\"org-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"org-function-name\">foo</span>(){ ... }\n    <span class=\"org-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"org-function-name\">bar</span>(){ ... }\n    <span class=\"org-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"org-function-name\">baz</span>(){ ... }\n}\n\n<span class=\"org-comment-delimiter\">// </span><span class=\"org-comment\">transforms into ==&gt;</span>\n\n<span class=\"org-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"org-function-name\">f</span>(<span class=\"org-variable-name\">a</span>, <span class=\"org-variable-name\">b</span>, <span class=\"org-variable-name\">c</span>) {\n    <span class=\"org-keyword\">var</span> <span class=\"org-variable-name\">i</span>, <span class=\"org-variable-name\">boo</span>, <span class=\"org-variable-name\">w</span> = 10, <span class=\"org-variable-name\">q</span> = 20;\n    <span class=\"org-keyword\">for</span> (i = 1; i &lt; 10; ++i) {\n        boo = foo(a);\n    }\n    <span class=\"org-keyword\">for</span> (i = 0; i &lt; 1; ++i) {\n        boo = bar(c);\n    }\n    <span class=\"org-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"org-function-name\">foo</span>() { ... }\n    <span class=\"org-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"org-function-name\">bar</span>() { ... }\n}\n</pre>\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>pro.ast_mangle(ast, options)</code> &ndash; generates a new AST containing mangled\n  (compressed) variable and function names.

Comments don't really\nmake sense in the AST, and while we could add nodes for them, it would be\ninconvenient because we'd have to add special rules to ignore them at all\nthe processing stages.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"outline-container-2-4-3\" class=\"outline-4\">\n<h4 id=\"sec-2-4-3\"><span class=\"section-number-4\">2.4.3</span> Use as a code pre-processor </h4>\n<div class=\"outline-text-4\" id=\"text-2-4-3\">\n\n\n<p>\nThe <code>--define</code> option can be used, particularly when combined with the\nconstant folding logic, as a form of pre-processor to enable or remove\nparticular constructions, such as might be used for instrumenting\ndevelopment code, or to produce variations aimed at a specific\nplatform.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe code below illustrates the way this can be done, and how the\nsymbol replacement is performed.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"src src-js\">CLAUSE1: <span class=\"org-keyword\">if</span> (<span class=\"org-keyword\">typeof</span> DEVMODE === <span class=\"org-string\">'undefined'</span>) {\n    DEVMODE = <span class=\"org-constant\">true</span>;\n}\n\n<span class=\"org-function-name\">CLAUSE2</span>: <span class=\"org-keyword\">function</span> init() {\n    <span class=\"org-keyword\">if</span> (DEVMODE) {\n        console.log(<span class=\"org-string\">\"init() called\"</span>);\n    }\n    ....\n    DEVMODE &amp;amp;&amp;amp; console.log(<span class=\"org-string\">\"init() complete\"</span>);\n}\n\n<span class=\"org-function-name\">CLAUSE3</span>: <span class=\"org-keyword\">function</span> reportDeviceStatus(<span class=\"org-variable-name\">device</span>) {\n    <span class=\"org-keyword\">var</span> <span class=\"org-variable-name\">DEVMODE</span> = device.mode, <span class=\"org-variable-name\">DEVNAME</span> = device.name;\n    <span class=\"org-keyword\">if</span> (DEVMODE === <span class=\"org-string\">'open'</span>) {\n        ....\n    }\n}\n</pre>\n\n\n<p>\nWhen the above code is normally executed, the undeclared global\nvariable <code>DEVMODE</code> will be assigned the value <b>true</b> (see <code>CLAUSE1</code>)\nand so the <code>init()</code> function (<code>CLAUSE2</code>) will write messages to the\nconsole log when executed, but in <code>CLAUSE3</code> a locally declared\nvariable will mask access to the <code>DEVMODE</code> global symbol.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf the above code is processed by UglifyJS with an argument of\n<code>--define DEVMODE=false</code> then UglifyJS will replace <code>DEVMODE</code> with the\nboolean constant value <b>false</b> within <code>CLAUSE1</code> and <code>CLAUSE2</code>, but it\nwill leave <code>CLAUSE3</code> as it stands because there <code>DEVMODE</code> resolves to\na validly declared variable.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd more so, the constant-folding features of UglifyJS will recognise\nthat the <code>if</code> condition of <code>CLAUSE1</code> is thus always false, and so will\nremove the test and body of <code>CLAUSE1</code> altogether (including the\notherwise slightly problematical statement <code>false = true;</code> which it\nwill have formed by replacing <code>DEVMODE</code> in the body).  Similarly,\nwithin <code>CLAUSE2</code> both calls to <code>console.log()</code> will be removed\naltogether.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn this way you can mimic, to a limited degree, the functionality of\nthe C/C++ pre-processor to enable or completely remove blocks\ndepending on how certain symbols are defined - perhaps using UglifyJS\nto generate different versions of source aimed at different\nenvironments\n</p>\n<p>\nIt is recommmended (but not made mandatory) that symbols designed for\nthis purpose are given names consisting of <code>UPPER_CASE_LETTERS</code> to\ndistinguish them from other (normal) symbols and avoid the sort of\nclash that <code>CLAUSE3</code> above illustrates.\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"outline-container-2-5\" class=\"outline-3\">\n<h3 id=\"sec-2-5\"><span class=\"section-number-3\">2.5</span> Compression &ndash; how good is it? </h3>\n<div class=\"outline-text-3\" id=\"text-2-5\">\n\n\n<p>\nHere are updated statistics.

For\n[API and internals documentation see my website](http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/).\nThere's also an\n[in-browser online demo](http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/#demo) (for Firefox,\nChrome and probably Safari).\n\nInstall\n-------\n\nFirst make sure you have installed the latest version of [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)\n(You may need to restart your computer after this step).\n\nFrom NPM for use as a command line app:\n\n    npm install uglify-js -g\n\nFrom NPM for programmatic use:\n\n    npm install uglify-js\n\nFrom Git:\n\n    git clone git://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2.git\n    cd UglifyJS2\n    npm link .\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n    uglifyjs [input files] [options]\n\nUglifyJS2 can take multiple input files.  It's recommended that you pass the\ninput files first, then pass the options.  UglifyJS will parse input files\nin sequence and apply any compression options.  The files are parsed in the\nsame global scope, that is, a reference from a file to some\nvariable/function declared in another file will be matched properly.\n\nIf you want to read from STDIN instead, pass a single dash instead of input\nfiles.\n\nThe available options are:\n\n```\n  --source-map       Specify an output file where to generate source map.\n                                                                        [string]\n  --source-map-root  The path to the original source to be included in the\n                     source map.                                        [string]\n  --source-map-url   The path to the source map to be added in //#\n                     sourceMappingURL.  Defaults to the value passed with\n                     --source-map.                                      [string]\n  --in-source-map    Input source map, useful if you're compressing JS that was\n                     generated from some other original code.\n  --screw-ie8        Pass this flag if you don't care about full compliance\n                     with Internet Explorer 6-8 quirks (by default UglifyJS\n                     will try to be IE-proof).                         [boolean]\n  --expr             Parse a single expression, rather than a program (for\n                     parsing JSON)                                     [boolean]\n  -p, --prefix       Skip prefix for original filenames that appear in source\n                     maps. For example -p 3 will drop 3 directories from file\n                     names and ensure they are relative paths. You can also\n                     specify -p relative, which will make UglifyJS figure out\n                     itself the relative paths between original sources, the\n                     source map and the output file.                    [string]\n  -o, --output       Output file (default STDOUT).\n  -b, --beautify     Beautify output/specify output options.            [string]\n  -m, --mangle       Mangle names/pass mangler options.                 [string]\n  -r, --reserved     Reserved names to exclude from mangling.\n  -c, --compress     Enable compressor/pass compressor options. Pass options\n                     like -c hoist_vars=false,if_return=false. Use -c with no\n                     argument to use the default compression options.   [string]\n  -d, --define       Global definitions                                 [string]\n  -e, --enclose      Embed everything in a big function, with a configurable\n                     parameter/argument list.                           [string]\n  --comments         Preserve copyright comments in the output. By default this\n                     works like Google Closure, keeping JSDoc-style comments\n                     that contain \"@license\" or \"@preserve\". You can optionally\n                     pass one of the following arguments to this flag:\n                     - \"all\" to keep all comments\n                     - a valid JS regexp (needs to start with a slash) to keep\n                     only comments that match.\n                     Note that currently not *all* comments can be kept when\n                     compression is on, because of dead code removal or\n                     cascading statements into sequences.               [string]\n  --stats            Display operations run time on STDERR.            [boolean]\n  --acorn            Use Acorn for parsing.                            [boolean]\n  --spidermonkey     Assume input files are SpiderMonkey AST format (as JSON).\n                                                                       [boolean]\n  --self             Build itself (UglifyJS2) as a library (implies\n                     --wrap=UglifyJS --export-all)                     [boolean]\n  --wrap             Embed everything in a big function, making the “exports”\n                     and “global” variables available. You need to pass an\n                     argument to this option to specify the name that your\n                     module will take when included in, say, a browser.\n                                                                        [string]\n  --export-all       Only used when --wrap, this tells UglifyJS to add code to\n                     automatically export all globals.                 [boolean]\n  --lint             Display some scope warnings                       [boolean]\n  -v, --verbose      Verbose                                           [boolean]\n  -V, --version      Print version number and exit.                    [boolean]\n```\n\nSpecify `--output` (`-o`) to declare the output file.  Otherwise the output\ngoes to STDOUT.\n\n## Source map options\n\nUglifyJS2 can generate a source map file, which is highly useful for\ndebugging your compressed JavaScript.  To get a source map, pass\n`--source-map output.js.map` (full path to the file where you want the\nsource map dumped).\n\nAdditionally you might need `--source-map-root` to pass the URL where the\noriginal files can be found.  In case you are passing full paths to input\nfiles to UglifyJS, you can use `--prefix` (`-p`) to specify the number of\ndirectories to drop from the path prefix when declaring files in the source\nmap.\n\nFor example:\n\n    uglifyjs /home/doe/work/foo/src/js/file1.js \\\n             /home/doe/work/foo/src/js/file2.js \\\n             -o foo.min.js \\\n             --source-map foo.min.js.map \\\n             --source-map-root http://foo.com/src \\\n             -p 5 -c -m\n\nThe above will compress and mangle `file1.js` and `file2.js`, will drop the\noutput in `foo.min.js` and the source map in `foo.min.js.map`.  The source\nmapping will refer to `http://foo.com/src/js/file1.js` and\n`http://foo.com/src/js/file2.js` (in fact it will list `http://foo.com/src`\nas the source map root, and the original files as `js/file1.js` and\n`js/file2.js`).\n\n### Composed source map\n\nWhen you're compressing JS code that was output by a compiler such as\nCoffeeScript, mapping to the JS code won't be too helpful.  Instead, you'd\nlike to map back to the original code (i.e. CoffeeScript).  UglifyJS has an\noption to take an input source map.  Assuming you have a mapping from\nCoffeeScript → compiled JS, UglifyJS can generate a map from CoffeeScript →\ncompressed JS by mapping every token in the compiled JS to its original\nlocation.\n\nTo use this feature you need to pass `--in-source-map\n/path/to/input/source.map`.  Normally the input source map should also point\nto the file containing the generated JS, so if that's correct you can omit\ninput files from the command line.\n\n## Mangler options\n\nTo enable the mangler you need to pass `--mangle` (`-m`).  The following\n(comma-separated) options are supported:\n\n- `sort` — to assign shorter names to most frequently used variables.  This\n  saves a few hundred bytes on jQuery before gzip, but the output is\n  _bigger_ after gzip (and seems to happen for other libraries I tried it\n  on) therefore it's not enabled by default.\n\n- `toplevel` — mangle names declared in the toplevel scope (disabled by\n  default).\n\n- `eval` — mangle names visible in scopes where `eval` or `when` are used\n  (disabled by default).\n\nWhen mangling is enabled but you want to prevent certain names from being\nmangled, you can declare those names with `--reserved` (`-r`) — pass a\ncomma-separated list of names.  For example:\n\n    uglifyjs ... -m -r '$,require,exports'\n\nto prevent the `require`, `exports` and `$` names from being changed.\n\n## Compressor options\n\nYou need to pass `--compress` (`-c`) to enable the compressor.  Optionally\nyou can pass a comma-separated list of options.  Options are in the form\n`foo=bar`, or just `foo` (the latter implies a boolean option that you want\nto set `true`; it's effectively a shortcut for `foo=true`).\n\n- `sequences` -- join consecutive simple statements using the comma operator\n- `properties` -- rewrite property access using the dot notation, for\n  example `foo[\"bar\"] → foo.bar`\n- `dead_code` -- remove unreachable code\n- `drop_debugger` -- remove `debugger;` statements\n- `unsafe` (default: false) -- apply \"unsafe\" transformations (discussion below)\n- `conditionals` -- apply optimizations for `if`-s and conditional\n  expressions\n- `comparisons` -- apply certain optimizations to binary nodes, for example:\n  `!(a <= b) → a > b` (only when `unsafe`), attempts to negate binary nodes,\n  e.g. `a = !b && !c && !d && !e → a=!(b||c||d||e)` etc.\n- `evaluate` -- attempt to evaluate constant expressions\n- `booleans` -- various optimizations for boolean context, for example `!!a\n  ? b : c → a ? b : c`\n- `loops` -- optimizations for `do`, `while` and `for` loops when we can\n  statically determine the condition\n- `unused` -- drop unreferenced functions and variables\n- `hoist_funs` -- hoist function declarations\n- `hoist_vars` (default: false) -- hoist `var` declarations (this is `false`\n  by default because it seems to increase the size of the output in general)\n- `if_return` -- optimizations for if/return and if/continue\n- `join_vars` -- join consecutive `var` statements\n- `cascade` -- small optimization for sequences, transform `x, x` into `x`\n  and `x = something(), x` into `x = something()`\n- `warnings` -- display warnings when dropping unreachable code or unused\n  declarations etc.\n- `negate_iife` -- negate \"Immediately-Called Function Expressions\"\n  where the return value is discarded, to avoid the parens that the\n  code generator would insert.\n\n### The `unsafe` option\n\nIt enables some transformations that *might* break code logic in certain\ncontrived cases, but should be fine for most code.  You might want to try it\non your own code, it should reduce the minified size.  Here's what happens\nwhen this flag is on:\n\n- `new Array(1, 2, 3)` or `Array(1, 2, 3)` → `[1, 2, 3 ]`\n- `new Object()` → `{}`\n- `String(exp)` or `exp.toString()` → `\"\" + exp`\n- `new Object/RegExp/Function/Error/Array (...)` → we discard the `new`\n- `typeof foo == \"undefined\"` → `foo === void 0`\n- `void 0` → `\"undefined\"` (if there is a variable named \"undefined\" in\n  scope; we do it because the variable name will be mangled, typically\n  reduced to a single character).\n\n### Conditional compilation\n\nYou can use the `--define` (`-d`) switch in order to declare global\nvariables that UglifyJS will assume to be constants (unless defined in\nscope).  For example if you pass `--define DEBUG=false` then, coupled with\ndead code removal UglifyJS will discard the following from the output:\n```javascript\nif (DEBUG) {\n\tconsole.log(\"debug stuff\");\n}\n```\n\nUglifyJS will warn about the condition being always false and about dropping\nunreachable code; for now there is no option to turn off only this specific\nwarning, you can pass `warnings=false` to turn off *all* warnings.\n\nAnother way of doing that is to declare your globals as constants in a\nseparate file and include it into the build.  For example you can have a\n`build/defines.js` file with the following:\n```javascript\nconst DEBUG = false;\nconst PRODUCTION = true;\n// etc.\n```\n\nand build your code like this:\n\n    uglifyjs build/defines.js js/foo.js js/bar.js... -c\n\nUglifyJS will notice the constants and, since they cannot be altered, it\nwill evaluate references to them to the value itself and drop unreachable\ncode as usual.  The possible downside of this approach is that the build\nwill contain the `const` declarations.\n\n<a name=\"codegen-options\"></a>\n## Beautifier options\n\nThe code generator tries to output shortest code possible by default.  In\ncase you want beautified output, pass `--beautify` (`-b`).  Optionally you\ncan pass additional arguments that control the code output:\n\n- `beautify` (default `true`) -- whether to actually beautify the output.\n  Passing `-b` will set this to true, but you might need to pass `-b` even\n  when you want to generate minified code, in order to specify additional\n  arguments, so you can use `-b beautify=false` to override it.\n- `indent-level` (default 4)\n- `indent-start` (default 0) -- prefix all lines by that many spaces\n- `quote-keys` (default `false`) -- pass `true` to quote all keys in literal\n  objects\n- `space-colon` (default `true`) -- insert a space after the colon signs\n- `ascii-only` (default `false`) -- escape Unicode characters in strings and\n  regexps\n- `inline-script` (default `false`) -- escape the slash in occurrences of\n  `</script` in strings\n- `width` (default 80) -- only takes effect when beautification is on, this\n  specifies an (orientative) line width that the beautifier will try to\n  obey.  It refers to the width of the line text (excluding indentation).\n  It doesn't work very well currently, but it does make the code generated\n  by UglifyJS more readable.\n- `max-line-len` (default 32000) -- maximum line length (for uglified code)\n- `bracketize` (default `false`) -- always insert brackets in `if`, `for`,\n  `do`, `while` or `with` statements, even if their body is a single\n  statement.\n- `semicolons` (default `true`) -- separate statements with semicolons.  If\n  you pass `false` then whenever possible we will use a newline instead of a\n  semicolon, leading to more readable output of uglified code (size before\n  gzip could be smaller; size after gzip insignificantly larger).\n\n### Keeping copyright notices or other comments\n\nYou can pass `--comments` to retain certain comments in the output.  By\ndefault it will keep JSDoc-style comments that contain \"@preserve\",\n\"@license\" or \"@cc_on\" (conditional compilation for IE).  You can pass\n`--comments all` to keep all the comments, or a valid JavaScript regexp to\nkeep only comments that match this regexp.  For example `--comments\n'/foo|bar/'` will keep only comments that contain \"foo\" or \"bar\".\n\nNote, however, that there might be situations where comments are lost.  For\nexample:\n```javascript\nfunction f() {\n\t/** @preserve Foo Bar */\n\tfunction g() {\n\t  // this function is never called\n\t}\n\treturn something();\n}\n```\n\nEven though it has \"@preserve\", the comment will be lost because the inner\nfunction `g` (which is the AST node to which the comment is attached to) is\ndiscarded by the compressor as not referenced.\n\nThe safest comments where to place copyright information (or other info that\nneeds to be kept in the output) are comments attached to toplevel nodes.\n\n## Support for the SpiderMonkey AST\n\nUglifyJS2 has its own abstract syntax tree format; for\n[practical reasons](http://lisperator.net/blog/uglifyjs-why-not-switching-to-spidermonkey-ast/)\nwe can't easily change to using the SpiderMonkey AST internally.  However,\nUglifyJS now has a converter which can import a SpiderMonkey AST.\n\nFor example [Acorn][acorn] is a super-fast parser that produces a\nSpiderMonkey AST.  It has a small CLI utility that parses one file and dumps\nthe AST in JSON on the standard output.  To use UglifyJS to mangle and\ncompress that:\n\n    acorn file.js | uglifyjs --spidermonkey -m -c\n\nThe `--spidermonkey` option tells UglifyJS that all input files are not\nJavaScript, but JS code described in SpiderMonkey AST in JSON.  Therefore we\ndon't use our own parser in this case, but just transform that AST into our\ninternal AST.\n\n### Use Acorn for parsing\n\nMore for fun, I added the `--acorn` option which will use Acorn to do all\nthe parsing.  If you pass this option, UglifyJS will `require(\"acorn\")`.\n\nAcorn is really fast (e.g. 250ms instead of 380ms on some 650K code), but\nconverting the SpiderMonkey tree that Acorn produces takes another 150ms so\nin total it's a bit more than just using UglifyJS's own parser.\n\nAPI Reference\n-------------\n\nAssuming installation via NPM, you can load UglifyJS in your application\nlike this:\n```javascript\nvar UglifyJS = require(\"uglify-js\");\n```\n\nIt exports a lot of names, but I'll discuss here the basics that are needed\nfor parsing, mangling and compressing a piece of code.  The sequence is (1)\nparse, (2) compress, (3) mangle, (4) generate output code.\n\n### The simple way\n\nThere's a single toplevel function which combines all the steps.  If you\ndon't need additional customization, you might want to go with `minify`.\nExample:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify(\"/path/to/file.js\");\nconsole.log(result.code); // minified output\n// if you need to pass code instead of file name\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify(\"var b = function () {};\", {fromString: true});\n```\n\nYou can also compress multiple files:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ]);\nconsole.log(result.code);\n```\n\nTo generate a source map:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ], {\n\toutSourceMap: \"out.js.map\"\n});\nconsole.log(result.code); // minified output\nconsole.log(result.map);\n```\n\nNote that the source map is not saved in a file, it's just returned in\n`result.map`.  The value passed for `outSourceMap` is only used to set the\n`file` attribute in the source map (see [the spec][sm-spec]).\n\nYou can also specify sourceRoot property to be included in source map:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ], {\n\toutSourceMap: \"out.js.map\",\n\tsourceRoot: \"http://example.com/src\"\n});\n```\n\nIf you're compressing compiled JavaScript and have a source map for it, you\ncan use the `inSourceMap` argument:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify(\"compiled.js\", {\n\tinSourceMap: \"compiled.js.map\",\n\toutSourceMap: \"minified.js.map\"\n});\n// same as before, it returns `code` and `map`\n```\n\nThe `inSourceMap` is only used if you also request `outSourceMap` (it makes\nno sense otherwise).\n\nOther options:\n\n- `warnings` (default `false`) — pass `true` to display compressor warnings.\n\n- `fromString` (default `false`) — if you pass `true` then you can pass\n  JavaScript source code, rather than file names.\n\n- `mangle` — pass `false` to skip mangling names.\n\n- `output` (default `null`) — pass an object if you wish to specify\n  additional [output options][codegen].  The defaults are optimized\n  for best compression.\n\n- `compress` (default `{}`) — pass `false` to skip compressing entirely.\n  Pass an object to specify custom [compressor options][compressor].\n\nWe could add more options to `UglifyJS.minify` — if you need additional\nfunctionality please suggest!\n\n### The hard way\n\nFollowing there's more detailed API info, in case the `minify` function is\ntoo simple for your needs.\n\n#### The parser\n```javascript\nvar toplevel_ast = UglifyJS.parse(code, options);\n```\n\n`options` is optional and if present it must be an object.  The following\nproperties are available:\n\n- `strict` — disable automatic semicolon insertion and support for trailing\n  comma in arrays and objects\n- `filename` — the name of the file where this code is coming from\n- `toplevel` — a `toplevel` node (as returned by a previous invocation of\n  `parse`)\n\nThe last two options are useful when you'd like to minify multiple files and\nget a single file as the output and a proper source map.  Our CLI tool does\nsomething like this:\n```javascript\nvar toplevel = null;\nfiles.forEach(function(file){\n\tvar code = fs.readFileSync(file);\n\ttoplevel = UglifyJS.parse(code, {\n\t\tfilename: file,\n\t\ttoplevel: toplevel\n\t});\n});\n```\n\nAfter this, we have in `toplevel` a big AST containing all our files, with\neach token having proper information about where it came from.\n\n#### Scope information\n\nUglifyJS contains a scope analyzer that you need to call manually before\ncompressing or mangling.  Basically it augments various nodes in the AST\nwith information about where is a name defined, how many times is a name\nreferenced, if it is a global or not, if a function is using `eval` or the\n`with` statement etc.  I will discuss this some place else, for now what's\nimportant to know is that you need to call the following before doing\nanything with the tree:\n```javascript\ntoplevel.figure_out_scope()\n```\n\n#### Compression\n\nLike this:\n```javascript\nvar compressor = UglifyJS.Compressor(options);\nvar compressed_ast = toplevel.transform(compressor);\n```\n\nThe `options` can be missing.  Available options are discussed above in\n“Compressor options”.  Defaults should lead to best compression in most\nscripts.\n\nThe compressor is destructive, so don't rely that `toplevel` remains the\noriginal tree.\n\n#### Mangling\n\nAfter compression it is a good idea to call again `figure_out_scope` (since\nthe compressor might drop unused variables / unreachable code and this might\nchange the number of identifiers or their position).  Optionally, you can\ncall a trick that helps after Gzip (counting character frequency in\nnon-mangleable words).  Example:\n```javascript\ncompressed_ast.figure_out_scope();\ncompressed_ast.compute_char_frequency();\ncompressed_ast.mangle_names();\n```\n\n#### Generating output\n\nAST nodes have a `print` method that takes an output stream.  Essentially,\nto generate code you do this:\n```javascript\nvar stream = UglifyJS.OutputStream(options);\ncompressed_ast.print(stream);\nvar code = stream.toString(); // this is your minified code\n```\n\nor, for a shortcut you can do:\n```javascript\nvar code = compressed_ast.print_to_string(options);\n```\n\nAs usual, `options` is optional.  The output stream accepts a lot of otions,\nmost of them documented above in section “Beautifier options”.  The two\nwhich we care about here are `source_map` and `comments`.\n\n#### Keeping comments in the output\n\nIn order to keep certain comments in the output you need to pass the\n`comments` option.  Pass a RegExp or a function.  If you pass a RegExp, only\nthose comments whose body matches the regexp will be kept.  Note that body\nmeans without the initial `//` or `/*`.  If you pass a function, it will be\ncalled for every comment in the tree and will receive two arguments: the\nnode that the comment is attached to, and the comment token itself.\n\nThe comment token has these properties:\n\n- `type`: \"comment1\" for single-line comments or \"comment2\" for multi-line\n  comments\n- `value`: the comment body\n- `pos` and `endpos`: the start/end positions (zero-based indexes) in the\n  original code where this comment appears\n- `line` and `col`: the line and column where this comment appears in the\n  original code\n- `file` — the file name of the original file\n- `nlb` — true if there was a newline before this comment in the original\n  code, or if this comment contains a newline.\n\nYour function should return `true` to keep the comment, or a falsy value\notherwise.\n\n#### Generating a source mapping\n\nYou need to pass the `source_map` argument when calling `print`.  It needs\nto be a `SourceMap` object (which is a thin wrapper on top of the\n[source-map][source-map] library).\n\nExample:\n```javascript\nvar source_map = UglifyJS.SourceMap(source_map_options);\nvar stream = UglifyJS.OutputStream({\n\t...\n\tsource_map: source_map\n});\ncompressed_ast.print(stream);\n\nvar code = stream.toString();\nvar map = source_map.toString(); // json output for your source map\n```\n\nThe `source_map_options` (optional) can contain the following properties:\n\n- `file`: the name of the JavaScript output file that this mapping refers to\n- `root`: the `sourceRoot` property (see the [spec][sm-spec])\n- `orig`: the \"original source map\", handy when you compress generated JS\n  and want to map the minified output back to the original code where it\n  came from.  It can be simply a string in JSON, or a JSON object containing\n  the original source map.\n\n  [acorn]: https://github.com/marijnh/acorn\n  [source-map]: https://github.com/mozilla/source-map\n  [sm-spec]: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1RGAehQwRypUTovF1KRlpiOFze0b-_2gc6fAH0KY0k/edit\n  [codegen]: http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/codegen\n  [compressor]: http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/compress\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2/issues"},"_id":"uglify-js@2.4.0","dist":{"shasum":"a5f2b6b1b817fb34c16a04234328c89ba1e77137","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/uglify-js/-/uglify-js-2.4.0.tgz"},"_from":".","_npmVersion":"1.2.21","_npmUser":{"name":"mishoo","email":"mihai.bazon@gmail.com"},"directories":{}},"2.4.1":{"name":"uglify-js","description":"JavaScript parser, mangler/compressor and beautifier toolkit","homepage":"http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs","main":"tools/node.js","version":"2.4.1","engines":{"node":">=0.4.0"},"maintainers":[{"name":"caires","email":"cairesvs@gmail.com"},{"name":"mape","email":"mape@mape.me"},{"name":"mishoo","email":"mihai.bazon@gmail.com"}],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2.git"},"dependencies":{"async":"~0.2.6","source-map":"~0.1.7","optimist":"~0.3.5","uglify-to-browserify":"~1.0.0"},"browserify":{"transform":["uglify-to-browserify"]},"bin":{"uglifyjs":"bin/uglifyjs"},"scripts":{"test":"node test/run-tests.js"},"readme":"UglifyJS 2\n==========\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mishoo/UglifyJS2.png)](https://travis-ci.org/mishoo/UglifyJS2)\n\nUglifyJS is a JavaScript parser, minifier, compressor or beautifier toolkit.\n\nThis page documents the command line utility.  For\n[API and internals documentation see my website](http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/).\nThere's also an\n[in-browser online demo](http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/#demo) (for Firefox,\nChrome and probably Safari).\n\nInstall\n-------\n\nFirst make sure you have installed the latest version of [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)\n(You may need to restart your computer after this step).\n\nFrom NPM for use as a command line app:\n\n    npm install uglify-js -g\n\nFrom NPM for programmatic use:\n\n    npm install uglify-js\n\nFrom Git:\n\n    git clone git://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2.git\n    cd UglifyJS2\n    npm link .\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n    uglifyjs [input files] [options]\n\nUglifyJS2 can take multiple input files.  It's recommended that you pass the\ninput files first, then pass the options.  UglifyJS will parse input files\nin sequence and apply any compression options.  The files are parsed in the\nsame global scope, that is, a reference from a file to some\nvariable/function declared in another file will be matched properly.\n\nIf you want to read from STDIN instead, pass a single dash instead of input\nfiles.\n\nThe available options are:\n\n```\n  --source-map       Specify an output file where to generate source map.\n                                                                        [string]\n  --source-map-root  The path to the original source to be included in the\n                     source map.                                        [string]\n  --source-map-url   The path to the source map to be added in //#\n                     sourceMappingURL.  Defaults to the value passed with\n                     --source-map.                                      [string]\n  --in-source-map    Input source map, useful if you're compressing JS that was\n                     generated from some other original code.\n  --screw-ie8        Pass this flag if you don't care about full compliance\n                     with Internet Explorer 6-8 quirks (by default UglifyJS\n                     will try to be IE-proof).                         [boolean]\n  --expr             Parse a single expression, rather than a program (for\n                     parsing JSON)                                     [boolean]\n  -p, --prefix       Skip prefix for original filenames that appear in source\n                     maps. For example -p 3 will drop 3 directories from file\n                     names and ensure they are relative paths. You can also\n                     specify -p relative, which will make UglifyJS figure out\n                     itself the relative paths between original sources, the\n                     source map and the output file.                    [string]\n  -o, --output       Output file (default STDOUT).\n  -b, --beautify     Beautify output/specify output options.            [string]\n  -m, --mangle       Mangle names/pass mangler options.                 [string]\n  -r, --reserved     Reserved names to exclude from mangling.\n  -c, --compress     Enable compressor/pass compressor options. Pass options\n                     like -c hoist_vars=false,if_return=false. Use -c with no\n                     argument to use the default compression options.

[string]\n  --comments         Preserve copyright comments in the output. By default this\n                     works like Google Closure, keeping JSDoc-style comments\n                     that contain \"@license\" or \"@preserve\". You can optionally\n                     pass one of the following arguments to this flag:\n                     - \"all\" to keep all comments\n                     - a valid JS regexp (needs to start with a slash) to keep\n                     only comments that match.\n                     Note that currently not *all* comments can be kept when\n                     compression is on, because of dead code removal or\n                     cascading statements into sequences.               [string]\n  --stats            Display operations run time on STDERR.            [boolean]\n  --acorn            Use Acorn for parsing.                            [boolean]\n  --spidermonkey     Assume input files are SpiderMonkey AST format (as JSON).\n                                                                       [boolean]\n  --self             Build itself (UglifyJS2) as a library (implies\n                     --wrap=UglifyJS --export-all)                     [boolean]\n  --wrap             Embed everything in a big function, making the “exports”\n                     and “global” variables available. You need to pass an\n                     argument to this option to specify the name that your\n                     module will take when included in, say, a browser.\n                                                                        [string]\n  --export-all       Only used when --wrap, this tells UglifyJS to add code to\n                     automatically export all globals.                 [boolean]\n  --lint             Display some scope warnings                       [boolean]\n  -v, --verbose      Verbose                                           [boolean]\n  -V, --version      Print version number and exit.                    [boolean]\n```\n\nSpecify `--output` (`-o`) to declare the output file.  Otherwise the output\ngoes to STDOUT.\n\n## Source map options\n\nUglifyJS2 can generate a source map file, which is highly useful for\ndebugging your compressed JavaScript.  To get a source map, pass\n`--source-map output.js.map` (full path to the file where you want the\nsource map dumped).\n\nAdditionally you might need `--source-map-root` to pass the URL where the\noriginal files can be found.  In case you are passing full paths to input\nfiles to UglifyJS, you can use `--prefix` (`-p`) to specify the number of\ndirectories to drop from the path prefix when declaring files in the source\nmap.\n\nFor example:\n\n    uglifyjs /home/doe/work/foo/src/js/file1.js \\\n             /home/doe/work/foo/src/js/file2.js \\\n             -o foo.min.js \\\n             --source-map foo.min.js.map \\\n             --source-map-root http://foo.com/src \\\n             -p 5 -c -m\n\nThe above will compress and mangle `file1.js` and `file2.js`, will drop the\noutput in `foo.min.js` and the source map in `foo.min.js.map`.  The source\nmapping will refer to `http://foo.com/src/js/file1.js` and\n`http://foo.com/src/js/file2.js` (in fact it will list `http://foo.com/src`\nas the source map root, and the original files as `js/file1.js` and\n`js/file2.js`).\n\n### Composed source map\n\nWhen you're compressing JS code that was output by a compiler such as\nCoffeeScript, mapping to the JS code won't be too helpful.  Instead, you'd\nlike to map back to the original code (i.e. CoffeeScript).  UglifyJS has an\noption to take an input source map.  Assuming you have a mapping from\nCoffeeScript → compiled JS, UglifyJS can generate a map from CoffeeScript →\ncompressed JS by mapping every token in the compiled JS to its original\nlocation.\n\nTo use this feature you need to pass `--in-source-map\n/path/to/input/source.map`.  Normally the input source map should also point\nto the file containing the generated JS, so if that's correct you can omit\ninput files from the command line.\n\n## Mangler options\n\nTo enable the mangler you need to pass `--mangle` (`-m`).  The following\n(comma-separated) options are supported:\n\n- `sort` — to assign shorter names to most frequently used variables.  This\n  saves a few hundred bytes on jQuery before gzip, but the output is\n  _bigger_ after gzip (and seems to happen for other libraries I tried it\n  on) therefore it's not enabled by default.\n\n- `toplevel` — mangle names declared in the toplevel scope (disabled by\n  default).\n\n- `eval` — mangle names visible in scopes where `eval` or `when` are used\n  (disabled by default).\n\nWhen mangling is enabled but you want to prevent certain names from being\nmangled, you can declare those names with `--reserved` (`-r`) — pass a\ncomma-separated list of names.  For example:\n\n    uglifyjs ... -m -r '$,require,exports'\n\nto prevent the `require`, `exports` and `$` names from being changed.\n\n## Compressor options\n\nYou need to pass `--compress` (`-c`) to enable the compressor.  Optionally\nyou can pass a comma-separated list of options.  Options are in the form\n`foo=bar`, or just `foo` (the latter implies a boolean option that you want\nto set `true`; it's effectively a shortcut for `foo=true`).\n\n- `sequences` -- join consecutive simple statements using the comma operator\n\n- `properties` -- rewrite property access using the dot notation, for\n  example `foo[\"bar\"] → foo.bar`\n\n- `dead_code` -- remove unreachable code\n\n- `drop_debugger` -- remove `debugger;` statements\n\n- `unsafe` (default: false) -- apply \"unsafe\" transformations (discussion below)\n\n- `conditionals` -- apply optimizations for `if`-s and conditional\n  expressions\n\n- `comparisons` -- apply certain optimizations to binary nodes, for example:\n  `!(a <= b) → a > b` (only when `unsafe`), attempts to negate binary nodes,\n  e.g. `a = !b && !c && !d && !e → a=!(b||c||d||e)` etc.\n\n- `evaluate` -- attempt to evaluate constant expressions\n\n- `booleans` -- various optimizations for boolean context, for example `!!a\n  ? b : c → a ? b : c`\n\n- `loops` -- optimizations for `do`, `while` and `for` loops when we can\n  statically determine the condition\n\n- `unused` -- drop unreferenced functions and variables\n\n- `hoist_funs` -- hoist function declarations\n\n- `hoist_vars` (default: false) -- hoist `var` declarations (this is `false`\n  by default because it seems to increase the size of the output in general)\n\n- `if_return` -- optimizations for if/return and if/continue\n\n- `join_vars` -- join consecutive `var` statements\n\n- `cascade` -- small optimization for sequences, transform `x, x` into `x`\n  and `x = something(), x` into `x = something()`\n\n- `warnings` -- display warnings when dropping unreachable code or unused\n  declarations etc.\n\n- `negate_iife` -- negate \"Immediately-Called Function Expressions\"\n  where the return value is discarded, to avoid the parens that the\n  code generator would insert.\n\n- `pure_getters` -- the default is `false`.  If you pass `true` for\n  this, UglifyJS will assume that object property access\n  (e.g. `foo.bar` or `foo[\"bar\"]`) doesn't have any side effects.\n\n- `pure_funcs` -- default `null`.  You can pass an array of names and\n  UglifyJS will assume that those functions do not produce side\n  effects.  DANGER: will not check if the name is redefined in scope.\n  An example case here, for instance `var q = Math.floor(a/b)`.  If\n  variable `q` is not used elsewhere, UglifyJS will drop it, but will\n  still keep the `Math.floor(a/b)`, not knowing what it does.  You can\n  pass `pure_funcs: [ 'Math.floor' ]` to let it know that this\n  function won't produce any side effect, in which case the whole\n  statement would get discarded.  The current implementation adds some\n  overhead (compression will be slower).\n\n### The `unsafe` option\n\nIt enables some transformations that *might* break code logic in certain\ncontrived cases, but should be fine for most code.  You might want to try it\non your own code, it should reduce the minified size.  Here's what happens\nwhen this flag is on:\n\n- `new Array(1, 2, 3)` or `Array(1, 2, 3)` → `[1, 2, 3 ]`\n- `new Object()` → `{}`\n- `String(exp)` or `exp.toString()` → `\"\" + exp`\n- `new Object/RegExp/Function/Error/Array (...)` → we discard the `new`\n- `typeof foo == \"undefined\"` → `foo === void 0`\n- `void 0` → `\"undefined\"` (if there is a variable named \"undefined\" in\n  scope; we do it because the variable name will be mangled, typically\n  reduced to a single character).\n\n### Conditional compilation\n\nYou can use the `--define` (`-d`) switch in order to declare global\nvariables that UglifyJS will assume to be constants (unless defined in\nscope).  For example if you pass `--define DEBUG=false` then, coupled with\ndead code removal UglifyJS will discard the following from the output:\n```javascript\nif (DEBUG) {\n\tconsole.log(\"debug stuff\");\n}\n```\n\nUglifyJS will warn about the condition being always false and about dropping\nunreachable code; for now there is no option to turn off only this specific\nwarning, you can pass `warnings=false` to turn off *all* warnings.\n\nAnother way of doing that is to declare your globals as constants in a\nseparate file and include it into the build.  For example you can have a\n`build/defines.js` file with the following:\n```javascript\nconst DEBUG = false;\nconst PRODUCTION = true;\n// etc.\n```\n\nand build your code like this:\n\n    uglifyjs build/defines.js js/foo.js js/bar.js... -c\n\nUglifyJS will notice the constants and, since they cannot be altered, it\nwill evaluate references to them to the value itself and drop unreachable\ncode as usual.  The possible downside of this approach is that the build\nwill contain the `const` declarations.\n\n<a name=\"codegen-options\"></a>\n## Beautifier options\n\nThe code generator tries to output shortest code possible by default.  In\ncase you want beautified output, pass `--beautify` (`-b`).  Optionally you\ncan pass additional arguments that control the code output:\n\n- `beautify` (default `true`) -- whether to actually beautify the output.\n  Passing `-b` will set this to true, but you might need to pass `-b` even\n  when you want to generate minified code, in order to specify additional\n  arguments, so you can use `-b beautify=false` to override it.\n- `indent-level` (default 4)\n- `indent-start` (default 0) -- prefix all lines by that many spaces\n- `quote-keys` (default `false`) -- pass `true` to quote all keys in literal\n  objects\n- `space-colon` (default `true`) -- insert a space after the colon signs\n- `ascii-only` (default `false`) -- escape Unicode characters in strings and\n  regexps\n- `inline-script` (default `false`) -- escape the slash in occurrences of\n  `</script` in strings\n- `width` (default 80) -- only takes effect when beautification is on, this\n  specifies an (orientative) line width that the beautifier will try to\n  obey.  It refers to the width of the line text (excluding indentation).\n  It doesn't work very well currently, but it does make the code generated\n  by UglifyJS more readable.\n- `max-line-len` (default 32000) -- maximum line length (for uglified code)\n- `bracketize` (default `false`) -- always insert brackets in `if`, `for`,\n  `do`, `while` or `with` statements, even if their body is a single\n  statement.\n- `semicolons` (default `true`) -- separate statements with semicolons.  If\n  you pass `false` then whenever possible we will use a newline instead of a\n  semicolon, leading to more readable output of uglified code (size before\n  gzip could be smaller; size after gzip insignificantly larger).\n\n### Keeping copyright notices or other comments\n\nYou can pass `--comments` to retain certain comments in the output.  By\ndefault it will keep JSDoc-style comments that contain \"@preserve\",\n\"@license\" or \"@cc_on\" (conditional compilation for IE).  You can pass\n`--comments all` to keep all the comments, or a valid JavaScript regexp to\nkeep only comments that match this regexp.  For example `--comments\n'/foo|bar/'` will keep only comments that contain \"foo\" or \"bar\".\n\nNote, however, that there might be situations where comments are lost.  For\nexample:\n```javascript\nfunction f() {\n\t/** @preserve Foo Bar */\n\tfunction g() {\n\t  // this function is never called\n\t}\n\treturn something();\n}\n```\n\nEven though it has \"@preserve\", the comment will be lost because the inner\nfunction `g` (which is the AST node to which the comment is attached to) is\ndiscarded by the compressor as not referenced.\n\nThe safest comments where to place copyright information (or other info that\nneeds to be kept in the output) are comments attached to toplevel nodes.\n\n## Support for the SpiderMonkey AST\n\nUglifyJS2 has its own abstract syntax tree format; for\n[practical reasons](http://lisperator.net/blog/uglifyjs-why-not-switching-to-spidermonkey-ast/)\nwe can't easily change to using the SpiderMonkey AST internally.  However,\nUglifyJS now has a converter which can import a SpiderMonkey AST.\n\nFor example [Acorn][acorn] is a super-fast parser that produces a\nSpiderMonkey AST.  It has a small CLI utility that parses one file and dumps\nthe AST in JSON on the standard output.  To use UglifyJS to mangle and\ncompress that:\n\n    acorn file.js | uglifyjs --spidermonkey -m -c\n\nThe `--spidermonkey` option tells UglifyJS that all input files are not\nJavaScript, but JS code described in SpiderMonkey AST in JSON.  Therefore we\ndon't use our own parser in this case, but just transform that AST into our\ninternal AST.\n\n### Use Acorn for parsing\n\nMore for fun, I added the `--acorn` option which will use Acorn to do all\nthe parsing.  If you pass this option, UglifyJS will `require(\"acorn\")`.\n\nAcorn is really fast (e.g. 250ms instead of 380ms on some 650K code), but\nconverting the SpiderMonkey tree that Acorn produces takes another 150ms so\nin total it's a bit more than just using UglifyJS's own parser.\n\nAPI Reference\n-------------\n\nAssuming installation via NPM, you can load UglifyJS in your application\nlike this:\n```javascript\nvar UglifyJS = require(\"uglify-js\");\n```\n\nIt exports a lot of names, but I'll discuss here the basics that are needed\nfor parsing, mangling and compressing a piece of code.  The sequence is (1)\nparse, (2) compress, (3) mangle, (4) generate output code.\n\n### The simple way\n\nThere's a single toplevel function which combines all the steps.  If you\ndon't need additional customization, you might want to go with `minify`.\nExample:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify(\"/path/to/file.js\");\nconsole.log(result.code); // minified output\n// if you need to pass code instead of file name\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify(\"var b = function () {};\", {fromString: true});\n```\n\nYou can also compress multiple files:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ]);\nconsole.log(result.code);\n```\n\nTo generate a source map:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ], {\n\toutSourceMap: \"out.js.map\"\n});\nconsole.log(result.code); // minified output\nconsole.log(result.map);\n```\n\nNote that the source map is not saved in a file, it's just returned in\n`result.map`.  The value passed for `outSourceMap` is only used to set the\n`file` attribute in the source map (see [the spec][sm-spec]).\n\nYou can also specify sourceRoot property to be included in source map:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ], {\n\toutSourceMap: \"out.js.map\",\n\tsourceRoot: \"http://example.com/src\"\n});\n```\n\nIf you're compressing compiled JavaScript and have a source map for it, you\ncan use the `inSourceMap` argument:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify(\"compiled.js\", {\n\tinSourceMap: \"compiled.js.map\",\n\toutSourceMap: \"minified.js.map\"\n});\n// same as before, it returns `code` and `map`\n```\n\nThe `inSourceMap` is only used if you also request `outSourceMap` (it makes\nno sense otherwise).\n\nOther options:\n\n- `warnings` (default `false`) — pass `true` to display compressor warnings.\n\n- `fromString` (default `false`) — if you pass `true` then you can pass\n  JavaScript source code, rather than file names.\n\n- `mangle` — pass `false` to skip mangling names.\n\n- `output` (default `null`) — pass an object if you wish to specify\n  additional [output options][codegen].  The defaults are optimized\n  for best compression.\n\n- `compress` (default `{}`) — pass `false` to skip compressing entirely.\n  Pass an object to specify custom [compressor options][compressor].\n\nWe could add more options to `UglifyJS.minify` — if you need additional\nfunctionality please suggest!\n\n### The hard way\n\nFollowing there's more detailed API info, in case the `minify` function is\ntoo simple for your needs.\n\n#### The parser\n```javascript\nvar toplevel_ast = UglifyJS.parse(code, options);\n```\n\n`options` is optional and if present it must be an object.  The following\nproperties are available:\n\n- `strict` — disable automatic semicolon insertion and support for trailing\n  comma in arrays and objects\n- `filename` — the name of the file where this code is coming from\n- `toplevel` — a `toplevel` node (as returned by a previous invocation of\n  `parse`)\n\nThe last two options are useful when you'd like to minify multiple files and\nget a single file as the output and a proper source map.  Our CLI tool does\nsomething like this:\n```javascript\nvar toplevel = null;\nfiles.forEach(function(file){\n\tvar code = fs.readFileSync(file);\n\ttoplevel = UglifyJS.parse(code, {\n\t\tfilename: file,\n\t\ttoplevel: toplevel\n\t});\n});\n```\n\nAfter this, we have in `toplevel` a big AST containing all our files, with\neach token having proper information about where it came from.\n\n#### Scope information\n\nUglifyJS contains a scope analyzer that you need to call manually before\ncompressing or mangling.  Basically it augments various nodes in the AST\nwith information about where is a name defined, how many times is a name\nreferenced, if it is a global or not, if a function is using `eval` or the\n`with` statement etc.  I will discuss this some place else, for now what's\nimportant to know is that you need to call the following before doing\nanything with the tree:\n```javascript\ntoplevel.figure_out_scope()\n```\n\n#### Compression\n\nLike this:\n```javascript\nvar compressor = UglifyJS.Compressor(options);\nvar compressed_ast = toplevel.transform(compressor);\n```\n\nThe `options` can be missing.  Available options are discussed above in\n“Compressor options”.  Defaults should lead to best compression in most\nscripts.\n\nThe compressor is destructive, so don't rely that `toplevel` remains the\noriginal tree.\n\n#### Mangling\n\nAfter compression it is a good idea to call again `figure_out_scope` (since\nthe compressor might drop unused variables / unreachable code and this might\nchange the number of identifiers or their position).  Optionally, you can\ncall a trick that helps after Gzip (counting character frequency in\nnon-mangleable words).  Example:\n```javascript\ncompressed_ast.figure_out_scope();\ncompressed_ast.compute_char_frequency();\ncompressed_ast.mangle_names();\n```\n\n#### Generating output\n\nAST nodes have a `print` method that takes an output stream.  Essentially,\nto generate code you do this:\n```javascript\nvar stream = UglifyJS.OutputStream(options);\ncompressed_ast.print(stream);\nvar code = stream.toString(); // this is your minified code\n```\n\nor, for a shortcut you can do:\n```javascript\nvar code = compressed_ast.print_to_string(options);\n```\n\nAs usual, `options` is optional.  The output stream accepts a lot of otions,\nmost of them documented above in section “Beautifier options”.  The two\nwhich we care about here are `source_map` and `comments`.\n\n#### Keeping comments in the output\n\nIn order to keep certain comments in the output you need to pass the\n`comments` option.  Pass a RegExp or a function.  If you pass a RegExp, only\nthose comments whose body matches the regexp will be kept.  Note that body\nmeans without the initial `//` or `/*`.  If you pass a function, it will be\ncalled for every comment in the tree and will receive two arguments: the\nnode that the comment is attached to, and the comment token itself.\n\nThe comment token has these properties:\n\n- `type`: \"comment1\" for single-line comments or \"comment2\" for multi-line\n  comments\n- `value`: the comment body\n- `pos` and `endpos`: the start/end positions (zero-based indexes) in the\n  original code where this comment appears\n- `line` and `col`: the line and column where this comment appears in the\n  original code\n- `file` — the file name of the original file\n- `nlb` — true if there was a newline before this comment in the original\n  code, or if this comment contains a newline.\n\nYour function should return `true` to keep the comment, or a falsy value\notherwise.\n\n#### Generating a source mapping\n\nYou need to pass the `source_map` argument when calling `print`.  It needs\nto be a `SourceMap` object (which is a thin wrapper on top of the\n[source-map][source-map] library).\n\nExample:\n```javascript\nvar source_map = UglifyJS.SourceMap(source_map_options);\nvar stream = UglifyJS.OutputStream({\n\t...\n\tsource_map: source_map\n});\ncompressed_ast.print(stream);\n\nvar code = stream.toString();\nvar map = source_map.toString(); // json output for your source map\n```\n\nThe `source_map_options` (optional) can contain the following properties:\n\n- `file`: the name of the JavaScript output file that this mapping refers to\n- `root`: the `sourceRoot` property (see the [spec][sm-spec])\n- `orig`: the \"original source map\", handy when you compress generated JS\n  and want to map the minified output back to the original code where it\n  came from.  It can be simply a string in JSON, or a JSON object containing\n  the original source map.\n\n  [acorn]: https://github.com/marijnh/acorn\n  [source-map]: https://github.com/mozilla/source-map\n  [sm-spec]: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1RGAehQwRypUTovF1KRlpiOFze0b-_2gc6fAH0KY0k/edit\n  [codegen]: http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/codegen\n  [compressor]: http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/compress\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2/issues"},"_id":"uglify-js@2.4.1","dist":{"shasum":"57b97aaf8160e5fa2118127e07082bf3a5c2b6e5","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/uglify-js/-/uglify-js-2.4.1.tgz"},"_from":".","_npmVersion":"1.2.21","_npmUser":{"name":"mishoo","email":"mihai.bazon@gmail.com"},"directories":{}},"2.4.2":{"name":"uglify-js","description":"JavaScript parser, mangler/compressor and beautifier toolkit","homepage":"http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs","main":"tools/node.js","version":"2.4.2","engines":{"node":">=0.4.0"},"maintainers":[{"name":"caires","email":"cairesvs@gmail.com"},{"name":"mape","email":"mape@mape.me"},{"name":"mishoo","email":"mihai.bazon@gmail.com"}],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2.git"},"dependencies":{"async":"~0.2.6","source-map":"~0.1.7","optimist":"~0.3.5","uglify-to-browserify":"~1.0.0"},"browserify":{"transform":["uglify-to-browserify"]},"bin":{"uglifyjs":"bin/uglifyjs"},"scripts":{"test":"node test/run-tests.js"},"readme":"UglifyJS 2\n==========\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mishoo/UglifyJS2.png)](https://travis-ci.org/mishoo/UglifyJS2)\n\nUglifyJS is a JavaScript parser, minifier, compressor or beautifier toolkit.\n\nThis page documents the command line utility.  For\n[API and internals documentation see my website](http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/).\nThere's also an\n[in-browser online demo](http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/#demo) (for Firefox,\nChrome and probably Safari).\n\nInstall\n-------\n\nFirst make sure you have installed the latest version of [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)\n(You may need to restart your computer after this step).\n\nFrom NPM for use as a command line app:\n\n    npm install uglify-js -g\n\nFrom NPM for programmatic use:\n\n    npm install uglify-js\n\nFrom Git:\n\n    git clone git://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2.git\n    cd UglifyJS2\n    npm link .\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n    uglifyjs [input files] [options]\n\nUglifyJS2 can take multiple input files.  It's recommended that you pass the\ninput files first, then pass the options.  UglifyJS will parse input files\nin sequence and apply any compression options.  The files are parsed in the\nsame global scope, that is, a reference from a file to some\nvariable/function declared in another file will be matched properly.\n\nIf you want to read from STDIN instead, pass a single dash instead of input\nfiles.\n\nThe available options are:\n\n```\n  --source-map       Specify an output file where to generate source map.\n                                                                        [string]\n  --source-map-root  The path to the original source to be included in the\n                     source map.                                        [string]\n  --source-map-url   The path to the source map to be added in //#\n                     sourceMappingURL.  Defaults to the value passed with\n                     --source-map.                                      [string]\n  --in-source-map    Input source map, useful if you're compressing JS that was\n                     generated from some other original code.\n  --screw-ie8        Pass this flag if you don't care about full compliance\n                     with Internet Explorer 6-8 quirks (by default UglifyJS\n                     will try to be IE-proof).                         [boolean]\n  --expr             Parse a single expression, rather than a program (for\n                     parsing JSON)                                     [boolean]\n  -p, --prefix       Skip prefix for original filenames that appear in source\n                     maps. For example -p 3 will drop 3 directories from file\n                     names and ensure they are relative paths. You can also\n                     specify -p relative, which will make UglifyJS figure out\n                     itself the relative paths between original sources, the\n                     source map and the output file.                    [string]\n  -o, --output       Output file (default STDOUT).\n  -b, --beautify     Beautify output/specify output options.            [string]\n  -m, --mangle       Mangle names/pass mangler options.                 [string]\n  -r, --reserved     Reserved names to exclude from mangling.\n  -c, --compress     Enable compressor/pass compressor options. Pass options\n                     like -c hoist_vars=false,if_return=false. Use -c with no\n                     argument to use the default compression options.   [string]\n  -d, --define       Global definitions                                 [string]\n  -e, --enclose      Embed everything in a big function, with a configurable\n                     parameter/argument list.                           [string]\n  --comments         Preserve copyright comments in the output. By default this\n                     works like Google Closure, keeping JSDoc-style comments\n                     that contain \"@license\" or \"@preserve\". You can optionally\n                     pass one of the following arguments to this flag:\n                     - \"all\" to keep all comments\n                     - a valid JS regexp (needs to start with a slash) to keep\n                     only comments that match.\n                     Note that currently not *all* comments can be kept when\n                     compression is on, because of dead code removal or\n                     cascading statements into sequences.               [string]\n  --preamble         Preamble to prepend to the output.  You can use this to\n                     insert a comment, for example for licensing information.\n                     This will not be parsed, but the source map will adjust\n                     for its presence.\n  --stats            Display operations run time on STDERR.

You need to pass an\n                     argument to this option to specify the name that your\n                     module will take when included in, say, a browser.\n                                                                        [string]\n  --export-all       Only used when --wrap, this tells UglifyJS to add code to\n                     automatically export all globals.

[boolean]\n```\n\nSpecify `--output` (`-o`) to declare the output file.  Otherwise the output\ngoes to STDOUT.\n\n## Source map options\n\nUglifyJS2 can generate a source map file, which is highly useful for\ndebugging your compressed JavaScript.  To get a source map, pass\n`--source-map output.js.map` (full path to the file where you want the\nsource map dumped).\n\nAdditionally you might need `--source-map-root` to pass the URL where the\noriginal files can be found.  In case you are passing full paths to input\nfiles to UglifyJS, you can use `--prefix` (`-p`) to specify the number of\ndirectories to drop from the path prefix when declaring files in the source\nmap.\n\nFor example:\n\n    uglifyjs /home/doe/work/foo/src/js/file1.js \\\n             /home/doe/work/foo/src/js/file2.js \\\n             -o foo.min.js \\\n             --source-map foo.min.js.map \\\n             --source-map-root http://foo.com/src \\\n             -p 5 -c -m\n\nThe above will compress and mangle `file1.js` and `file2.js`, will drop the\noutput in `foo.min.js` and the source map in `foo.min.js.map`.  The source\nmapping will refer to `http://foo.com/src/js/file1.js` and\n`http://foo.com/src/js/file2.js` (in fact it will list `http://foo.com/src`\nas the source map root, and the original files as `js/file1.js` and\n`js/file2.js`).\n\n### Composed source map\n\nWhen you're compressing JS code that was output by a compiler such as\nCoffeeScript, mapping to the JS code won't be too helpful.  Instead, you'd\nlike to map back to the original code (i.e. CoffeeScript).  UglifyJS has an\noption to take an input source map.  Assuming you have a mapping from\nCoffeeScript → compiled JS, UglifyJS can generate a map from CoffeeScript →\ncompressed JS by mapping every token in the compiled JS to its original\nlocation.\n\nTo use this feature you need to pass `--in-source-map\n/path/to/input/source.map`.  Normally the input source map should also point\nto the file containing the generated JS, so if that's correct you can omit\ninput files from the command line.\n\n## Mangler options\n\nTo enable the mangler you need to pass `--mangle` (`-m`).  The following\n(comma-separated) options are supported:\n\n- `sort` — to assign shorter names to most frequently used variables.  This\n  saves a few hundred bytes on jQuery before gzip, but the output is\n  _bigger_ after gzip (and seems to happen for other libraries I tried it\n  on) therefore it's not enabled by default.\n\n- `toplevel` — mangle names declared in the toplevel scope (disabled by\n  default).\n\n- `eval` — mangle names visible in scopes where `eval` or `when` are used\n  (disabled by default).\n\nWhen mangling is enabled but you want to prevent certain names from being\nmangled, you can declare those names with `--reserved` (`-r`) — pass a\ncomma-separated list of names.  For example:\n\n    uglifyjs ... -m -r '$,require,exports'\n\nto prevent the `require`, `exports` and `$` names from being changed.\n\n## Compressor options\n\nYou need to pass `--compress` (`-c`) to enable the compressor.  Optionally\nyou can pass a comma-separated list of options.  Options are in the form\n`foo=bar`, or just `foo` (the latter implies a boolean option that you want\nto set `true`; it's effectively a shortcut for `foo=true`).\n\n- `sequences` -- join consecutive simple statements using the comma operator\n\n- `properties` -- rewrite property access using the dot notation, for\n  example `foo[\"bar\"] → foo.bar`\n\n- `dead_code` -- remove unreachable code\n\n- `drop_debugger` -- remove `debugger;` statements\n\n- `unsafe` (default: false) -- apply \"unsafe\" transformations (discussion below)\n\n- `conditionals` -- apply optimizations for `if`-s and conditional\n  expressions\n\n- `comparisons` -- apply certain optimizations to binary nodes, for example:\n  `!(a <= b) → a > b` (only when `unsafe`), attempts to negate binary nodes,\n  e.g. `a = !b && !c && !d && !e → a=!(b||c||d||e)` etc.\n\n- `evaluate` -- attempt to evaluate constant expressions\n\n- `booleans` -- various optimizations for boolean context, for example `!!a\n  ? b : c → a ? b : c`\n\n- `loops` -- optimizations for `do`, `while` and `for` loops when we can\n  statically determine the condition\n\n- `unused` -- drop unreferenced functions and variables\n\n- `hoist_funs` -- hoist function declarations\n\n- `hoist_vars` (default: false) -- hoist `var` declarations (this is `false`\n  by default because it seems to increase the size of the output in general)\n\n- `if_return` -- optimizations for if/return and if/continue\n\n- `join_vars` -- join consecutive `var` statements\n\n- `cascade` -- small optimization for sequences, transform `x, x` into `x`\n  and `x = something(), x` into `x = something()`\n\n- `warnings` -- display warnings when dropping unreachable code or unused\n  declarations etc.\n\n- `negate_iife` -- negate \"Immediately-Called Function Expressions\"\n  where the return value is discarded, to avoid the parens that the\n  code generator would insert.\n\n- `pure_getters` -- the default is `false`.  If you pass `true` for\n  this, UglifyJS will assume that object property access\n  (e.g. `foo.bar` or `foo[\"bar\"]`) doesn't have any side effects.\n\n- `pure_funcs` -- default `null`.  You can pass an array of names and\n  UglifyJS will assume that those functions do not produce side\n  effects.  DANGER: will not check if the name is redefined in scope.\n  An example case here, for instance `var q = Math.floor(a/b)`.  If\n  variable `q` is not used elsewhere, UglifyJS will drop it, but will\n  still keep the `Math.floor(a/b)`, not knowing what it does.  You can\n  pass `pure_funcs: [ 'Math.floor' ]` to let it know that this\n  function won't produce any side effect, in which case the whole\n  statement would get discarded.  The current implementation adds some\n  overhead (compression will be slower).\n\n### The `unsafe` option\n\nIt enables some transformations that *might* break code logic in certain\ncontrived cases, but should be fine for most code.  You might want to try it\non your own code, it should reduce the minified size.  Here's what happens\nwhen this flag is on:\n\n- `new Array(1, 2, 3)` or `Array(1, 2, 3)` → `[1, 2, 3 ]`\n- `new Object()` → `{}`\n- `String(exp)` or `exp.toString()` → `\"\" + exp`\n- `new Object/RegExp/Function/Error/Array (...)` → we discard the `new`\n- `typeof foo == \"undefined\"` → `foo === void 0`\n- `void 0` → `undefined` (if there is a variable named \"undefined\" in\n  scope; we do it because the variable name will be mangled, typically\n  reduced to a single character).\n\n### Conditional compilation\n\nYou can use the `--define` (`-d`) switch in order to declare global\nvariables that UglifyJS will assume to be constants (unless defined in\nscope).  For example if you pass `--define DEBUG=false` then, coupled with\ndead code removal UglifyJS will discard the following from the output:\n```javascript\nif (DEBUG) {\n\tconsole.log(\"debug stuff\");\n}\n```\n\nUglifyJS will warn about the condition being always false and about dropping\nunreachable code; for now there is no option to turn off only this specific\nwarning, you can pass `warnings=false` to turn off *all* warnings.\n\nAnother way of doing that is to declare your globals as constants in a\nseparate file and include it into the build.  For example you can have a\n`build/defines.js` file with the following:\n```javascript\nconst DEBUG = false;\nconst PRODUCTION = true;\n// etc.\n```\n\nand build your code like this:\n\n    uglifyjs build/defines.js js/foo.js js/bar.js... -c\n\nUglifyJS will notice the constants and, since they cannot be altered, it\nwill evaluate references to them to the value itself and drop unreachable\ncode as usual.  The possible downside of this approach is that the build\nwill contain the `const` declarations.\n\n<a name=\"codegen-options\"></a>\n## Beautifier options\n\nThe code generator tries to output shortest code possible by default.  In\ncase you want beautified output, pass `--beautify` (`-b`).  Optionally you\ncan pass additional arguments that control the code output:\n\n- `beautify` (default `true`) -- whether to actually beautify the output.\n  Passing `-b` will set this to true, but you might need to pass `-b` even\n  when you want to generate minified code, in order to specify additional\n  arguments, so you can use `-b beautify=false` to override it.\n- `indent-level` (default 4)\n- `indent-start` (default 0) -- prefix all lines by that many spaces\n- `quote-keys` (default `false`) -- pass `true` to quote all keys in literal\n  objects\n- `space-colon` (default `true`) -- insert a space after the colon signs\n- `ascii-only` (default `false`) -- escape Unicode characters in strings and\n  regexps\n- `inline-script` (default `false`) -- escape the slash in occurrences of\n  `</script` in strings\n- `width` (default 80) -- only takes effect when beautification is on, this\n  specifies an (orientative) line width that the beautifier will try to\n  obey.  It refers to the width of the line text (excluding indentation).\n  It doesn't work very well currently, but it does make the code generated\n  by UglifyJS more readable.\n- `max-line-len` (default 32000) -- maximum line length (for uglified code)\n- `bracketize` (default `false`) -- always insert brackets in `if`, `for`,\n  `do`, `while` or `with` statements, even if their body is a single\n  statement.\n- `semicolons` (default `true`) -- separate statements with semicolons.  If\n  you pass `false` then whenever possible we will use a newline instead of a\n  semicolon, leading to more readable output of uglified code (size before\n  gzip could be smaller; size after gzip insignificantly larger).\n- `preamble` (default `null`) -- when passed it must be a string and\n  it will be prepended to the output literally.  The source map will\n  adjust for this text.  Can be used to insert a comment containing\n  licensing information, for example.\n\n### Keeping copyright notices or other comments\n\nYou can pass `--comments` to retain certain comments in the output.  By\ndefault it will keep JSDoc-style comments that contain \"@preserve\",\n\"@license\" or \"@cc_on\" (conditional compilation for IE).  You can pass\n`--comments all` to keep all the comments, or a valid JavaScript regexp to\nkeep only comments that match this regexp.  For example `--comments\n'/foo|bar/'` will keep only comments that contain \"foo\" or \"bar\".\n\nNote, however, that there might be situations where comments are lost.  For\nexample:\n```javascript\nfunction f() {\n\t/** @preserve Foo Bar */\n\tfunction g() {\n\t  // this function is never called\n\t}\n\treturn something();\n}\n```\n\nEven though it has \"@preserve\", the comment will be lost because the inner\nfunction `g` (which is the AST node to which the comment is attached to) is\ndiscarded by the compressor as not referenced.\n\nThe safest comments where to place copyright information (or other info that\nneeds to be kept in the output) are comments attached to toplevel nodes.\n\n## Support for the SpiderMonkey AST\n\nUglifyJS2 has its own abstract syntax tree format; for\n[practical reasons](http://lisperator.net/blog/uglifyjs-why-not-switching-to-spidermonkey-ast/)\nwe can't easily change to using the SpiderMonkey AST internally.  However,\nUglifyJS now has a converter which can import a SpiderMonkey AST.\n\nFor example [Acorn][acorn] is a super-fast parser that produces a\nSpiderMonkey AST.  It has a small CLI utility that parses one file and dumps\nthe AST in JSON on the standard output.  To use UglifyJS to mangle and\ncompress that:\n\n    acorn file.js | uglifyjs --spidermonkey -m -c\n\nThe `--spidermonkey` option tells UglifyJS that all input files are not\nJavaScript, but JS code described in SpiderMonkey AST in JSON.  Therefore we\ndon't use our own parser in this case, but just transform that AST into our\ninternal AST.\n\n### Use Acorn for parsing\n\nMore for fun, I added the `--acorn` option which will use Acorn to do all\nthe parsing.  If you pass this option, UglifyJS will `require(\"acorn\")`.\n\nAcorn is really fast (e.g. 250ms instead of 380ms on some 650K code), but\nconverting the SpiderMonkey tree that Acorn produces takes another 150ms so\nin total it's a bit more than just using UglifyJS's own parser.\n\nAPI Reference\n-------------\n\nAssuming installation via NPM, you can load UglifyJS in your application\nlike this:\n```javascript\nvar UglifyJS = require(\"uglify-js\");\n```\n\nIt exports a lot of names, but I'll discuss here the basics that are needed\nfor parsing, mangling and compressing a piece of code.  The sequence is (1)\nparse, (2) compress, (3) mangle, (4) generate output code.\n\n### The simple way\n\nThere's a single toplevel function which combines all the steps.  If you\ndon't need additional customization, you might want to go with `minify`.\nExample:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify(\"/path/to/file.js\");\nconsole.log(result.code); // minified output\n// if you need to pass code instead of file name\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify(\"var b = function () {};\", {fromString: true});\n```\n\nYou can also compress multiple files:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ]);\nconsole.log(result.code);\n```\n\nTo generate a source map:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ], {\n\toutSourceMap: \"out.js.map\"\n});\nconsole.log(result.code); // minified output\nconsole.log(result.map);\n```\n\nNote that the source map is not saved in a file, it's just returned in\n`result.map`.  The value passed for `outSourceMap` is only used to set the\n`file` attribute in the source map (see [the spec][sm-spec]).\n\nYou can also specify sourceRoot property to be included in source map:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ], {\n\toutSourceMap: \"out.js.map\",\n\tsourceRoot: \"http://example.com/src\"\n});\n```\n\nIf you're compressing compiled JavaScript and have a source map for it, you\ncan use the `inSourceMap` argument:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify(\"compiled.js\", {\n\tinSourceMap: \"compiled.js.map\",\n\toutSourceMap: \"minified.js.map\"\n});\n// same as before, it returns `code` and `map`\n```\n\nThe `inSourceMap` is only used if you also request `outSourceMap` (it makes\nno sense otherwise).\n\nOther options:\n\n- `warnings` (default `false`) — pass `true` to display compressor warnings.\n\n- `fromString` (default `false`) — if you pass `true` then you can pass\n  JavaScript source code, rather than file names.\n\n- `mangle` — pass `false` to skip mangling names.\n\n- `output` (default `null`) — pass an object if you wish to specify\n  additional [output options][codegen].  The defaults are optimized\n  for best compression.\n\n- `compress` (default `{}`) — pass `false` to skip compressing entirely.\n  Pass an object to specify custom [compressor options][compressor].\n\nWe could add more options to `UglifyJS.minify` — if you need additional\nfunctionality please suggest!\n\n### The hard way\n\nFollowing there's more detailed API info, in case the `minify` function is\ntoo simple for your needs.\n\n#### The parser\n```javascript\nvar toplevel_ast = UglifyJS.parse(code, options);\n```\n\n`options` is optional and if present it must be an object.  The following\nproperties are available:\n\n- `strict` — disable automatic semicolon insertion and support for trailing\n  comma in arrays and objects\n- `filename` — the name of the file where this code is coming from\n- `toplevel` — a `toplevel` node (as returned by a previous invocation of\n  `parse`)\n\nThe last two options are useful when you'd like to minify multiple files and\nget a single file as the output and a proper source map.  Our CLI tool does\nsomething like this:\n```javascript\nvar toplevel = null;\nfiles.forEach(function(file){\n\tvar code = fs.readFileSync(file);\n\ttoplevel = UglifyJS.parse(code, {\n\t\tfilename: file,\n\t\ttoplevel: toplevel\n\t});\n});\n```\n\nAfter this, we have in `toplevel` a big AST containing all our files, with\neach token having proper information about where it came from.\n\n#### Scope information\n\nUglifyJS contains a scope analyzer that you need to call manually before\ncompressing or mangling.  Basically it augments various nodes in the AST\nwith information about where is a name defined, how many times is a name\nreferenced, if it is a global or not, if a function is using `eval` or the\n`with` statement etc.  I will discuss this some place else, for now what's\nimportant to know is that you need to call the following before doing\nanything with the tree:\n```javascript\ntoplevel.figure_out_scope()\n```\n\n#### Compression\n\nLike this:\n```javascript\nvar compressor = UglifyJS.Compressor(options);\nvar compressed_ast = toplevel.transform(compressor);\n```\n\nThe `options` can be missing.  Available options are discussed above in\n“Compressor options”.  Defaults should lead to best compression in most\nscripts.\n\nThe compressor is destructive, so don't rely that `toplevel` remains the\noriginal tree.\n\n#### Mangling\n\nAfter compression it is a good idea to call again `figure_out_scope` (since\nthe compressor might drop unused variables / unreachable code and this might\nchange the number of identifiers or their position).  Optionally, you can\ncall a trick that helps after Gzip (counting character frequency in\nnon-mangleable words).  Example:\n```javascript\ncompressed_ast.figure_out_scope();\ncompressed_ast.compute_char_frequency();\ncompressed_ast.mangle_names();\n```\n\n#### Generating output\n\nAST nodes have a `print` method that takes an output stream.  Essentially,\nto generate code you do this:\n```javascript\nvar stream = UglifyJS.OutputStream(options);\ncompressed_ast.print(stream);\nvar code = stream.toString(); // this is your minified code\n```\n\nor, for a shortcut you can do:\n```javascript\nvar code = compressed_ast.print_to_string(options);\n```\n\nAs usual, `options` is optional.  The output stream accepts a lot of otions,\nmost of them documented above in section “Beautifier options”.  The two\nwhich we care about here are `source_map` and `comments`.\n\n#### Keeping comments in the output\n\nIn order to keep certain comments in the output you need to pass the\n`comments` option.  Pass a RegExp or a function.  If you pass a RegExp, only\nthose comments whose body matches the regexp will be kept.  Note that body\nmeans without the initial `//` or `/*`.  If you pass a function, it will be\ncalled for every comment in the tree and will receive two arguments: the\nnode that the comment is attached to, and the comment token itself.\n\nThe comment token has these properties:\n\n- `type`: \"comment1\" for single-line comments or \"comment2\" for multi-line\n  comments\n- `value`: the comment body\n- `pos` and `endpos`: the start/end positions (zero-based indexes) in the\n  original code where this comment appears\n- `line` and `col`: the line and column where this comment appears in the\n  original code\n- `file` — the file name of the original file\n- `nlb` — true if there was a newline before this comment in the original\n  code, or if this comment contains a newline.\n\nYour function should return `true` to keep the comment, or a falsy value\notherwise.\n\n#### Generating a source mapping\n\nYou need to pass the `source_map` argument when calling `print`.  It needs\nto be a `SourceMap` object (which is a thin wrapper on top of the\n[source-map][source-map] library).\n\nExample:\n```javascript\nvar source_map = UglifyJS.SourceMap(source_map_options);\nvar stream = UglifyJS.OutputStream({\n\t...\n\tsource_map: source_map\n});\ncompressed_ast.print(stream);\n\nvar code = stream.toString();\nvar map = source_map.toString(); // json output for your source map\n```\n\nThe `source_map_options` (optional) can contain the following properties:\n\n- `file`: the name of the JavaScript output file that this mapping refers to\n- `root`: the `sourceRoot` property (see the [spec][sm-spec])\n- `orig`: the \"original source map\", handy when you compress generated JS\n  and want to map the minified output back to the original code where it\n  came from.  It can be simply a string in JSON, or a JSON object containing\n  the original source map.\n\n  [acorn]: https://github.com/marijnh/acorn\n  [source-map]: https://github.com/mozilla/source-map\n  [sm-spec]: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1RGAehQwRypUTovF1KRlpiOFze0b-_2gc6fAH0KY0k/edit\n  [codegen]: http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/codegen\n  [compressor]: http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/compress\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2/issues"},"_id":"uglify-js@2.4.2","dist":{"shasum":"9301b81a179b7f82be0118f0768d8df01a8afe89","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/uglify-js/-/uglify-js-2.4.2.tgz"},"_from":".","_npmVersion":"1.2.21","_npmUser":{"name":"mishoo","email":"mihai.bazon@gmail.com"},"directories":{}},"2.4.3":{"name":"uglify-js","description":"JavaScript parser, mangler/compressor and beautifier toolkit","homepage":"http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs","main":"tools/node.js","version":"2.4.3","engines":{"node":">=0.4.0"},"maintainers":[{"name":"caires","email":"cairesvs@gmail.com"},{"name":"mape","email":"mape@mape.me"},{"name":"mishoo","email":"mihai.bazon@gmail.com"}],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2.git"},"dependencies":{"async":"~0.2.6","source-map":"~0.1.7","optimist":"~0.3.5","uglify-to-browserify":"~1.0.0"},"browserify":{"transform":["uglify-to-browserify"]},"bin":{"uglifyjs":"bin/uglifyjs"},"scripts":{"test":"node test/run-tests.js"},"readme":"UglifyJS 2\n==========\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mishoo/UglifyJS2.png)](https://travis-ci.org/mishoo/UglifyJS2)\n\nUglifyJS is a JavaScript parser, minifier, compressor or beautifier toolkit.\n\nThis page documents the command line utility.

The files are parsed in the\nsame global scope, that is, a reference from a file to some\nvariable/function declared in another file will be matched properly.\n\nIf you want to read from STDIN instead, pass a single dash instead of input\nfiles.\n\nThe available options are:\n\n```\n  --source-map       Specify an output file where to generate source map.\n                                                                        [string]\n  --source-map-root  The path to the original source to be included in the\n                     source map.                                        [string]\n  --source-map-url   The path to the source map to be added in //#\n                     sourceMappingURL.  Defaults to the value passed with\n                     --source-map.                                      [string]\n  --in-source-map    Input source map, useful if you're compressing JS that was\n                     generated from some other original code.\n  --screw-ie8        Pass this flag if you don't care about full compliance\n                     with Internet Explorer 6-8 quirks (by default UglifyJS\n                     will try to be IE-proof).                         [boolean]\n  --expr             Parse a single expression, rather than a program (for\n                     parsing JSON)                                     [boolean]\n  -p, --prefix       Skip prefix for original filenames that appear in source\n                     maps. For example -p 3 will drop 3 directories from file\n                     names and ensure they are relative paths. You can also\n                     specify -p relative, which will make UglifyJS figure out\n                     itself the relative paths between original sources, the\n                     source map and the output file.                    [string]\n  -o, --output       Output file (default STDOUT).\n  -b, --beautify     Beautify output/specify output options.            [string]\n  -m, --mangle       Mangle names/pass mangler options.                 [string]\n  -r, --reserved     Reserved names to exclude from mangling.\n  -c, --compress     Enable compressor/pass compressor options. Pass options\n                     like -c hoist_vars=false,if_return=false. Use -c with no\n                     argument to use the default compression options.   [string]\n  -d, --define       Global definitions                                 [string]\n  -e, --enclose      Embed everything in a big function, with a configurable\n                     parameter/argument list.                           [string]\n  --comments         Preserve copyright comments in the output. By default this\n                     works like Google Closure, keeping JSDoc-style comments\n                     that contain \"@license\" or \"@preserve\". You can optionally\n                     pass one of the following arguments to this flag:\n                     - \"all\" to keep all comments\n                     - a valid JS regexp (needs to start with a slash) to keep\n                     only comments that match.\n                     Note that currently not *all* comments can be kept when\n                     compression is on, because of dead code removal or\n                     cascading statements into sequences.               [string]\n  --preamble         Preamble to prepend to the output.  You can use this to\n                     insert a comment, for example for licensing information.\n                     This will not be parsed, but the source map will adjust\n                     for its presence.\n  --stats            Display operations run time on STDERR.            [boolean]\n  --acorn            Use Acorn for parsing.                            [boolean]\n  --spidermonkey     Assume input files are SpiderMonkey AST format (as JSON).\n                                                                       [boolean]\n  --self             Build itself (UglifyJS2) as a library (implies\n                     --wrap=UglifyJS --export-all)                     [boolean]\n  --wrap             Embed everything in a big function, making the “exports”\n                     and “global” variables available. You need to pass an\n                     argument to this option to specify the name that your\n                     module will take when included in, say, a browser.\n                                                                        [string]\n  --export-all       Only used when --wrap, this tells UglifyJS to add code to\n                     automatically export all globals.                 [boolean]\n  --lint             Display some scope warnings                       [boolean]\n  -v, --verbose      Verbose                                           [boolean]\n  -V, --version      Print version number and exit.                    [boolean]\n```\n\nSpecify `--output` (`-o`) to declare the output file.  Otherwise the output\ngoes to STDOUT.\n\n## Source map options\n\nUglifyJS2 can generate a source map file, which is highly useful for\ndebugging your compressed JavaScript.  To get a source map, pass\n`--source-map output.js.map` (full path to the file where you want the\nsource map dumped).\n\nAdditionally you might need `--source-map-root` to pass the URL where the\noriginal files can be found.  In case you are passing full paths to input\nfiles to UglifyJS, you can use `--prefix` (`-p`) to specify the number of\ndirectories to drop from the path prefix when declaring files in the source\nmap.\n\nFor example:\n\n    uglifyjs /home/doe/work/foo/src/js/file1.js \\\n             /home/doe/work/foo/src/js/file2.js \\\n             -o foo.min.js \\\n             --source-map foo.min.js.map \\\n             --source-map-root http://foo.com/src \\\n             -p 5 -c -m\n\nThe above will compress and mangle `file1.js` and `file2.js`, will drop the\noutput in `foo.min.js` and the source map in `foo.min.js.map`.  The source\nmapping will refer to `http://foo.com/src/js/file1.js` and\n`http://foo.com/src/js/file2.js` (in fact it will list `http://foo.com/src`\nas the source map root, and the original files as `js/file1.js` and\n`js/file2.js`).\n\n### Composed source map\n\nWhen you're compressing JS code that was output by a compiler such as\nCoffeeScript, mapping to the JS code won't be too helpful.  Instead, you'd\nlike to map back to the original code (i.e. CoffeeScript).  UglifyJS has an\noption to take an input source map.  Assuming you have a mapping from\nCoffeeScript → compiled JS, UglifyJS can generate a map from CoffeeScript →\ncompressed JS by mapping every token in the compiled JS to its original\nlocation.\n\nTo use this feature you need to pass `--in-source-map\n/path/to/input/source.map`.  Normally the input source map should also point\nto the file containing the generated JS, so if that's correct you can omit\ninput files from the command line.\n\n## Mangler options\n\nTo enable the mangler you need to pass `--mangle` (`-m`).  The following\n(comma-separated) options are supported:\n\n- `sort` — to assign shorter names to most frequently used variables.  This\n  saves a few hundred bytes on jQuery before gzip, but the output is\n  _bigger_ after gzip (and seems to happen for other libraries I tried it\n  on) therefore it's not enabled by default.\n\n- `toplevel` — mangle names declared in the toplevel scope (disabled by\n  default).\n\n- `eval` — mangle names visible in scopes where `eval` or `when` are used\n  (disabled by default).\n\nWhen mangling is enabled but you want to prevent certain names from being\nmangled, you can declare those names with `--reserved` (`-r`) — pass a\ncomma-separated list of names.  For example:\n\n    uglifyjs ... -m -r '$,require,exports'\n\nto prevent the `require`, `exports` and `$` names from being changed.\n\n## Compressor options\n\nYou need to pass `--compress` (`-c`) to enable the compressor.  Optionally\nyou can pass a comma-separated list of options.  Options are in the form\n`foo=bar`, or just `foo` (the latter implies a boolean option that you want\nto set `true`; it's effectively a shortcut for `foo=true`).\n\n- `sequences` -- join consecutive simple statements using the comma operator\n\n- `properties` -- rewrite property access using the dot notation, for\n  example `foo[\"bar\"] → foo.bar`\n\n- `dead_code` -- remove unreachable code\n\n- `drop_debugger` -- remove `debugger;` statements\n\n- `unsafe` (default: false) -- apply \"unsafe\" transformations (discussion below)\n\n- `conditionals` -- apply optimizations for `if`-s and conditional\n  expressions\n\n- `comparisons` -- apply certain optimizations to binary nodes, for example:\n  `!(a <= b) → a > b` (only when `unsafe`), attempts to negate binary nodes,\n  e.g. `a = !b && !c && !d && !e → a=!(b||c||d||e)` etc.\n\n- `evaluate` -- attempt to evaluate constant expressions\n\n- `booleans` -- various optimizations for boolean context, for example `!!a\n  ? b : c → a ? b : c`\n\n- `loops` -- optimizations for `do`, `while` and `for` loops when we can\n  statically determine the condition\n\n- `unused` -- drop unreferenced functions and variables\n\n- `hoist_funs` -- hoist function declarations\n\n- `hoist_vars` (default: false) -- hoist `var` declarations (this is `false`\n  by default because it seems to increase the size of the output in general)\n\n- `if_return` -- optimizations for if/return and if/continue\n\n- `join_vars` -- join consecutive `var` statements\n\n- `cascade` -- small optimization for sequences, transform `x, x` into `x`\n  and `x = something(), x` into `x = something()`\n\n- `warnings` -- display warnings when dropping unreachable code or unused\n  declarations etc.\n\n- `negate_iife` -- negate \"Immediately-Called Function Expressions\"\n  where the return value is discarded, to avoid the parens that the\n  code generator would insert.\n\n- `pure_getters` -- the default is `false`.  If you pass `true` for\n  this, UglifyJS will assume that object property access\n  (e.g. `foo.bar` or `foo[\"bar\"]`) doesn't have any side effects.\n\n- `pure_funcs` -- default `null`.  You can pass an array of names and\n  UglifyJS will assume that those functions do not produce side\n  effects.  DANGER: will not check if the name is redefined in scope.\n  An example case here, for instance `var q = Math.floor(a/b)`.  If\n  variable `q` is not used elsewhere, UglifyJS will drop it, but will\n  still keep the `Math.floor(a/b)`, not knowing what it does.  You can\n  pass `pure_funcs: [ 'Math.floor' ]` to let it know that this\n  function won't produce any side effect, in which case the whole\n  statement would get discarded.  The current implementation adds some\n  overhead (compression will be slower).\n\n### The `unsafe` option\n\nIt enables some transformations that *might* break code logic in certain\ncontrived cases, but should be fine for most code.  You might want to try it\non your own code, it should reduce the minified size.  Here's what happens\nwhen this flag is on:\n\n- `new Array(1, 2, 3)` or `Array(1, 2, 3)` → `[1, 2, 3 ]`\n- `new Object()` → `{}`\n- `String(exp)` or `exp.toString()` → `\"\" + exp`\n- `new Object/RegExp/Function/Error/Array (...)` → we discard the `new`\n- `typeof foo == \"undefined\"` → `foo === void 0`\n- `void 0` → `undefined` (if there is a variable named \"undefined\" in\n  scope; we do it because the variable name will be mangled, typically\n  reduced to a single character).\n\n### Conditional compilation\n\nYou can use the `--define` (`-d`) switch in order to declare global\nvariables that UglifyJS will assume to be constants (unless defined in\nscope).  For example if you pass `--define DEBUG=false` then, coupled with\ndead code removal UglifyJS will discard the following from the output:\n```javascript\nif (DEBUG) {\n\tconsole.log(\"debug stuff\");\n}\n```\n\nUglifyJS will warn about the condition being always false and about dropping\nunreachable code; for now there is no option to turn off only this specific\nwarning, you can pass `warnings=false` to turn off *all* warnings.\n\nAnother way of doing that is to declare your globals as constants in a\nseparate file and include it into the build.  For example you can have a\n`build/defines.js` file with the following:\n```javascript\nconst DEBUG = false;\nconst PRODUCTION = true;\n// etc.\n```\n\nand build your code like this:\n\n    uglifyjs build/defines.js js/foo.js js/bar.js... -c\n\nUglifyJS will notice the constants and, since they cannot be altered, it\nwill evaluate references to them to the value itself and drop unreachable\ncode as usual.  The possible downside of this approach is that the build\nwill contain the `const` declarations.\n\n<a name=\"codegen-options\"></a>\n## Beautifier options\n\nThe code generator tries to output shortest code possible by default.  In\ncase you want beautified output, pass `--beautify` (`-b`).  Optionally you\ncan pass additional arguments that control the code output:\n\n- `beautify` (default `true`) -- whether to actually beautify the output.\n  Passing `-b` will set this to true, but you might need to pass `-b` even\n  when you want to generate minified code, in order to specify additional\n  arguments, so you can use `-b beautify=false` to override it.\n- `indent-level` (default 4)\n- `indent-start` (default 0) -- prefix all lines by that many spaces\n- `quote-keys` (default `false`) -- pass `true` to quote all keys in literal\n  objects\n- `space-colon` (default `true`) -- insert a space after the colon signs\n- `ascii-only` (default `false`) -- escape Unicode characters in strings and\n  regexps\n- `inline-script` (default `false`) -- escape the slash in occurrences of\n  `</script` in strings\n- `width` (default 80) -- only takes effect when beautification is on, this\n  specifies an (orientative) line width that the beautifier will try to\n  obey.  It refers to the width of the line text (excluding indentation).\n  It doesn't work very well currently, but it does make the code generated\n  by UglifyJS more readable.\n- `max-line-len` (default 32000) -- maximum line length (for uglified code)\n- `bracketize` (default `false`) -- always insert brackets in `if`, `for`,\n  `do`, `while` or `with` statements, even if their body is a single\n  statement.\n- `semicolons` (default `true`) -- separate statements with semicolons.  If\n  you pass `false` then whenever possible we will use a newline instead of a\n  semicolon, leading to more readable output of uglified code (size before\n  gzip could be smaller; size after gzip insignificantly larger).\n- `preamble` (default `null`) -- when passed it must be a string and\n  it will be prepended to the output literally.  The source map will\n  adjust for this text.  Can be used to insert a comment containing\n  licensing information, for example.\n\n### Keeping copyright notices or other comments\n\nYou can pass `--comments` to retain certain comments in the output.  By\ndefault it will keep JSDoc-style comments that contain \"@preserve\",\n\"@license\" or \"@cc_on\" (conditional compilation for IE).  You can pass\n`--comments all` to keep all the comments, or a valid JavaScript regexp to\nkeep only comments that match this regexp.  For example `--comments\n'/foo|bar/'` will keep only comments that contain \"foo\" or \"bar\".\n\nNote, however, that there might be situations where comments are lost.  For\nexample:\n```javascript\nfunction f() {\n\t/** @preserve Foo Bar */\n\tfunction g() {\n\t  // this function is never called\n\t}\n\treturn something();\n}\n```\n\nEven though it has \"@preserve\", the comment will be lost because the inner\nfunction `g` (which is the AST node to which the comment is attached to) is\ndiscarded by the compressor as not referenced.\n\nThe safest comments where to place copyright information (or other info that\nneeds to be kept in the output) are comments attached to toplevel nodes.\n\n## Support for the SpiderMonkey AST\n\nUglifyJS2 has its own abstract syntax tree format; for\n[practical reasons](http://lisperator.net/blog/uglifyjs-why-not-switching-to-spidermonkey-ast/)\nwe can't easily change to using the SpiderMonkey AST internally.  However,\nUglifyJS now has a converter which can import a SpiderMonkey AST.\n\nFor example [Acorn][acorn] is a super-fast parser that produces a\nSpiderMonkey AST.  It has a small CLI utility that parses one file and dumps\nthe AST in JSON on the standard output.  To use UglifyJS to mangle and\ncompress that:\n\n    acorn file.js | uglifyjs --spidermonkey -m -c\n\nThe `--spidermonkey` option tells UglifyJS that all input files are not\nJavaScript, but JS code described in SpiderMonkey AST in JSON.  Therefore we\ndon't use our own parser in this case, but just transform that AST into our\ninternal AST.\n\n### Use Acorn for parsing\n\nMore for fun, I added the `--acorn` option which will use Acorn to do all\nthe parsing.  If you pass this option, UglifyJS will `require(\"acorn\")`.\n\nAcorn is really fast (e.g. 250ms instead of 380ms on some 650K code), but\nconverting the SpiderMonkey tree that Acorn produces takes another 150ms so\nin total it's a bit more than just using UglifyJS's own parser.\n\nAPI Reference\n-------------\n\nAssuming installation via NPM, you can load UglifyJS in your application\nlike this:\n```javascript\nvar UglifyJS = require(\"uglify-js\");\n```\n\nIt exports a lot of names, but I'll discuss here the basics that are needed\nfor parsing, mangling and compressing a piece of code.  The sequence is (1)\nparse, (2) compress, (3) mangle, (4) generate output code.\n\n### The simple way\n\nThere's a single toplevel function which combines all the steps.  If you\ndon't need additional customization, you might want to go with `minify`.\nExample:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify(\"/path/to/file.js\");\nconsole.log(result.code); // minified output\n// if you need to pass code instead of file name\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify(\"var b = function () {};\", {fromString: true});\n```\n\nYou can also compress multiple files:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ]);\nconsole.log(result.code);\n```\n\nTo generate a source map:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ], {\n\toutSourceMap: \"out.js.map\"\n});\nconsole.log(result.code); // minified output\nconsole.log(result.map);\n```\n\nNote that the source map is not saved in a file, it's just returned in\n`result.map`.  The value passed for `outSourceMap` is only used to set the\n`file` attribute in the source map (see [the spec][sm-spec]).\n\nYou can also specify sourceRoot property to be included in source map:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ], {\n\toutSourceMap: \"out.js.map\",\n\tsourceRoot: \"http://example.com/src\"\n});\n```\n\nIf you're compressing compiled JavaScript and have a source map for it, you\ncan use the `inSourceMap` argument:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify(\"compiled.js\", {\n\tinSourceMap: \"compiled.js.map\",\n\toutSourceMap: \"minified.js.map\"\n});\n// same as before, it returns `code` and `map`\n```\n\nThe `inSourceMap` is only used if you also request `outSourceMap` (it makes\nno sense otherwise).\n\nOther options:\n\n- `warnings` (default `false`) — pass `true` to display compressor warnings.\n\n- `fromString` (default `false`) — if you pass `true` then you can pass\n  JavaScript source code, rather than file names.\n\n- `mangle` — pass `false` to skip mangling names.\n\n- `output` (default `null`) — pass an object if you wish to specify\n  additional [output options][codegen].  The defaults are optimized\n  for best compression.\n\n- `compress` (default `{}`) — pass `false` to skip compressing entirely.\n  Pass an object to specify custom [compressor options][compressor].\n\nWe could add more options to `UglifyJS.minify` — if you need additional\nfunctionality please suggest!\n\n### The hard way\n\nFollowing there's more detailed API info, in case the `minify` function is\ntoo simple for your needs.\n\n#### The parser\n```javascript\nvar toplevel_ast = UglifyJS.parse(code, options);\n```\n\n`options` is optional and if present it must be an object.  The following\nproperties are available:\n\n- `strict` — disable automatic semicolon insertion and support for trailing\n  comma in arrays and objects\n- `filename` — the name of the file where this code is coming from\n- `toplevel` — a `toplevel` node (as returned by a previous invocation of\n  `parse`)\n\nThe last two options are useful when you'd like to minify multiple files and\nget a single file as the output and a proper source map.  Our CLI tool does\nsomething like this:\n```javascript\nvar toplevel = null;\nfiles.forEach(function(file){\n\tvar code = fs.readFileSync(file);\n\ttoplevel = UglifyJS.parse(code, {\n\t\tfilename: file,\n\t\ttoplevel: toplevel\n\t});\n});\n```\n\nAfter this, we have in `toplevel` a big AST containing all our files, with\neach token having proper information about where it came from.\n\n#### Scope information\n\nUglifyJS contains a scope analyzer that you need to call manually before\ncompressing or mangling.  Basically it augments various nodes in the AST\nwith information about where is a name defined, how many times is a name\nreferenced, if it is a global or not, if a function is using `eval` or the\n`with` statement etc.  I will discuss this some place else, for now what's\nimportant to know is that you need to call the following before doing\nanything with the tree:\n```javascript\ntoplevel.figure_out_scope()\n```\n\n#### Compression\n\nLike this:\n```javascript\nvar compressor = UglifyJS.Compressor(options);\nvar compressed_ast = toplevel.transform(compressor);\n```\n\nThe `options` can be missing.  Available options are discussed above in\n“Compressor options”.  Defaults should lead to best compression in most\nscripts.\n\nThe compressor is destructive, so don't rely that `toplevel` remains the\noriginal tree.\n\n#### Mangling\n\nAfter compression it is a good idea to call again `figure_out_scope` (since\nthe compressor might drop unused variables / unreachable code and this might\nchange the number of identifiers or their position).  Optionally, you can\ncall a trick that helps after Gzip (counting character frequency in\nnon-mangleable words).  Example:\n```javascript\ncompressed_ast.figure_out_scope();\ncompressed_ast.compute_char_frequency();\ncompressed_ast.mangle_names();\n```\n\n#### Generating output\n\nAST nodes have a `print` method that takes an output stream.  Essentially,\nto generate code you do this:\n```javascript\nvar stream = UglifyJS.OutputStream(options);\ncompressed_ast.print(stream);\nvar code = stream.toString(); // this is your minified code\n```\n\nor, for a shortcut you can do:\n```javascript\nvar code = compressed_ast.print_to_string(options);\n```\n\nAs usual, `options` is optional.  The output stream accepts a lot of otions,\nmost of them documented above in section “Beautifier options”.  The two\nwhich we care about here are `source_map` and `comments`.\n\n#### Keeping comments in the output\n\nIn order to keep certain comments in the output you need to pass the\n`comments` option.  Pass a RegExp or a function.  If you pass a RegExp, only\nthose comments whose body matches the regexp will be kept.  Note that body\nmeans without the initial `//` or `/*`.  If you pass a function, it will be\ncalled for every comment in the tree and will receive two arguments: the\nnode that the comment is attached to, and the comment token itself.\n\nThe comment token has these properties:\n\n- `type`: \"comment1\" for single-line comments or \"comment2\" for multi-line\n  comments\n- `value`: the comment body\n- `pos` and `endpos`: the start/end positions (zero-based indexes) in the\n  original code where this comment appears\n- `line` and `col`: the line and column where this comment appears in the\n  original code\n- `file` — the file name of the original file\n- `nlb` — true if there was a newline before this comment in the original\n  code, or if this comment contains a newline.\n\nYour function should return `true` to keep the comment, or a falsy value\notherwise.\n\n#### Generating a source mapping\n\nYou need to pass the `source_map` argument when calling `print`.  It needs\nto be a `SourceMap` object (which is a thin wrapper on top of the\n[source-map][source-map] library).\n\nExample:\n```javascript\nvar source_map = UglifyJS.SourceMap(source_map_options);\nvar stream = UglifyJS.OutputStream({\n\t...\n\tsource_map: source_map\n});\ncompressed_ast.print(stream);\n\nvar code = stream.toString();\nvar map = source_map.toString(); // json output for your source map\n```\n\nThe `source_map_options` (optional) can contain the following properties:\n\n- `file`: the name of the JavaScript output file that this mapping refers to\n- `root`: the `sourceRoot` property (see the [spec][sm-spec])\n- `orig`: the \"original source map\", handy when you compress generated JS\n  and want to map the minified output back to the original code where it\n  came from.  It can be simply a string in JSON, or a JSON object containing\n  the original source map.\n\n  [acorn]: https://github.com/marijnh/acorn\n  [source-map]: https://github.com/mozilla/source-map\n  [sm-spec]: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1RGAehQwRypUTovF1KRlpiOFze0b-_2gc6fAH0KY0k/edit\n  [codegen]: http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/codegen\n  [compressor]: http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/compress\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2/issues"},"_id":"uglify-js@2.4.3","dist":{"shasum":"6883cd4b837a4d004191c9ea05394cfa596c3748","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/uglify-js/-/uglify-js-2.4.3.tgz"},"_from":".","_npmVersion":"1.2.21","_npmUser":{"name":"mishoo","email":"mihai.bazon@gmail.com"},"directories":{}},"2.4.4":{"name":"uglify-js","description":"JavaScript parser, mangler/compressor and beautifier toolkit","homepage":"http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs","main":"tools/node.js","version":"2.4.4","engines":{"node":">=0.4.0"},"maintainers":[{"name":"caires","email":"cairesvs@gmail.com"},{"name":"mape","email":"mape@mape.me"},{"name":"mishoo","email":"mihai.bazon@gmail.com"}],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2.git"},"dependencies":{"async":"~0.2.6","source-map":"~0.1.7","optimist":"~0.3.5","uglify-to-browserify":"~1.0.0"},"browserify":{"transform":["uglify-to-browserify"]},"bin":{"uglifyjs":"bin/uglifyjs"},"scripts":{"test":"node test/run-tests.js"},"readme":"UglifyJS 2\n==========\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mishoo/UglifyJS2.png)](https://travis-ci.org/mishoo/UglifyJS2)\n\nUglifyJS is a JavaScript parser, minifier, compressor or beautifier toolkit.\n\nThis page documents the command line utility.  For\n[API and internals documentation see my website](http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/).\nThere's also an\n[in-browser online demo](http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/#demo) (for Firefox,\nChrome and probably Safari).\n\nInstall\n-------\n\nFirst make sure you have installed the latest version of [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)\n(You may need to restart your computer after this step).\n\nFrom NPM for use as a command line app:\n\n    npm install uglify-js -g\n\nFrom NPM for programmatic use:\n\n    npm install uglify-js\n\nFrom Git:\n\n    git clone git://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2.git\n    cd UglifyJS2\n    npm link .\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n    uglifyjs [input files] [options]\n\nUglifyJS2 can take multiple input files.  It's recommended that you pass the\ninput files first, then pass the options.  UglifyJS will parse input files\nin sequence and apply any compression options.  The files are parsed in the\nsame global scope, that is, a reference from a file to some\nvariable/function declared in another file will be matched properly.\n\nIf you want to read from STDIN instead, pass a single dash instead of input\nfiles.\n\nThe available options are:\n\n```\n  --source-map       Specify an output file where to generate source map.\n                                                                        [string]\n  --source-map-root  The path to the original source to be included in the\n                     source map.                                        [string]\n  --source-map-url   The path to the source map to be added in //#\n                     sourceMappingURL.  Defaults to the value passed with\n                     --source-map.                                      [string]\n  --in-source-map    Input source map, useful if you're compressing JS that was\n                     generated from some other original code.\n  --screw-ie8        Pass this flag if you don't care about full compliance\n                     with Internet Explorer 6-8 quirks (by default UglifyJS\n                     will try to be IE-proof).                         [boolean]\n  --expr             Parse a single expression, rather than a program (for\n                     parsing JSON)                                     [boolean]\n  -p, --prefix       Skip prefix for original filenames that appear in source\n                     maps. For example -p 3 will drop 3 directories from file\n                     names and ensure they are relative paths. You can also\n                     specify -p relative, which will make UglifyJS figure out\n                     itself the relative paths between original sources, the\n                     source map and the output file.                    [string]\n  -o, --output       Output file (default STDOUT).\n  -b, --beautify     Beautify output/specify output options.            [string]\n  -m, --mangle       Mangle names/pass mangler options.                 [string]\n  -r, --reserved     Reserved names to exclude from mangling.\n  -c, --compress     Enable compressor/pass compressor options. Pass options\n                     like -c hoist_vars=false,if_return=false. Use -c with no\n                     argument to use the default compression options.   [string]\n  -d, --define       Global definitions                                 [string]\n  -e, --enclose      Embed everything in a big function, with a configurable\n                     parameter/argument list.                           [string]\n  --comments         Preserve copyright comments in the output. By default this\n                     works like Google Closure, keeping JSDoc-style comments\n                     that contain \"@license\" or \"@preserve\". You can optionally\n                     pass one of the following arguments to this flag:\n                     - \"all\" to keep all comments\n                     - a valid JS regexp (needs to start with a slash) to keep\n                     only comments that match.\n                     Note that currently not *all* comments can be kept when\n                     compression is on, because of dead code removal or\n                     cascading statements into sequences.               [string]\n  --preamble         Preamble to prepend to the output.  You can use this to\n                     insert a comment, for example for licensing information.\n                     This will not be parsed, but the source map will adjust\n                     for its presence.\n  --stats            Display operations run time on STDERR.            [boolean]\n  --acorn            Use Acorn for parsing.                            [boolean]\n  --spidermonkey     Assume input files are SpiderMonkey AST format (as JSON).\n                                                                       [boolean]\n  --self             Build itself (UglifyJS2) as a library (implies\n                     --wrap=UglifyJS --export-all)                     [boolean]\n  --wrap             Embed everything in a big function, making the “exports”\n                     and “global” variables available. You need to pass an\n                     argument to this option to specify the name that your\n                     module will take when included in, say, a browser.\n                                                                        [string]\n  --export-all       Only used when --wrap, this tells UglifyJS to add code to\n                     automatically export all globals.                 [boolean]\n  --lint             Display some scope warnings                       [boolean]\n  -v, --verbose      Verbose                                           [boolean]\n  -V, --version      Print version number and exit.                    [boolean]\n```\n\nSpecify `--output` (`-o`) to declare the output file.  Otherwise the output\ngoes to STDOUT.\n\n## Source map options\n\nUglifyJS2 can generate a source map file, which is highly useful for\ndebugging your compressed JavaScript.  To get a source map, pass\n`--source-map output.js.map` (full path to the file where you want the\nsource map dumped).\n\nAdditionally you might need `--source-map-root` to pass the URL where the\noriginal files can be found.  In case you are passing full paths to input\nfiles to UglifyJS, you can use `--prefix` (`-p`) to specify the number of\ndirectories to drop from the path prefix when declaring files in the source\nmap.\n\nFor example:\n\n    uglifyjs /home/doe/work/foo/src/js/file1.js \\\n             /home/doe/work/foo/src/js/file2.js \\\n             -o foo.min.js \\\n             --source-map foo.min.js.map \\\n             --source-map-root http://foo.com/src \\\n             -p 5 -c -m\n\nThe above will compress and mangle `file1.js` and `file2.js`, will drop the\noutput in `foo.min.js` and the source map in `foo.min.js.map`.  The source\nmapping will refer to `http://foo.com/src/js/file1.js` and\n`http://foo.com/src/js/file2.js` (in fact it will list `http://foo.com/src`\nas the source map root, and the original files as `js/file1.js` and\n`js/file2.js`).\n\n### Composed source map\n\nWhen you're compressing JS code that was output by a compiler such as\nCoffeeScript, mapping to the JS code won't be too helpful.  Instead, you'd\nlike to map back to the original code (i.e. CoffeeScript).  UglifyJS has an\noption to take an input source map.  Assuming you have a mapping from\nCoffeeScript → compiled JS, UglifyJS can generate a map from CoffeeScript →\ncompressed JS by mapping every token in the compiled JS to its original\nlocation.\n\nTo use this feature you need to pass `--in-source-map\n/path/to/input/source.map`.  Normally the input source map should also point\nto the file containing the generated JS, so if that's correct you can omit\ninput files from the command line.\n\n## Mangler options\n\nTo enable the mangler you need to pass `--mangle` (`-m`).  The following\n(comma-separated) options are supported:\n\n- `sort` — to assign shorter names to most frequently used variables.  This\n  saves a few hundred bytes on jQuery before gzip, but the output is\n  _bigger_ after gzip (and seems to happen for other libraries I tried it\n  on) therefore it's not enabled by default.\n\n- `toplevel` — mangle names declared in the toplevel scope (disabled by\n  default).\n\n- `eval` — mangle names visible in scopes where `eval` or `when` are used\n  (disabled by default).\n\nWhen mangling is enabled but you want to prevent certain names from being\nmangled, you can declare those names with `--reserved` (`-r`) — pass a\ncomma-separated list of names.  For example:\n\n    uglifyjs ... -m -r '$,require,exports'\n\nto prevent the `require`, `exports` and `$` names from being changed.\n\n## Compressor options\n\nYou need to pass `--compress` (`-c`) to enable the compressor.  Optionally\nyou can pass a comma-separated list of options.  Options are in the form\n`foo=bar`, or just `foo` (the latter implies a boolean option that you want\nto set `true`; it's effectively a shortcut for `foo=true`).\n\n- `sequences` -- join consecutive simple statements using the comma operator\n\n- `properties` -- rewrite property access using the dot notation, for\n  example `foo[\"bar\"] → foo.bar`\n\n- `dead_code` -- remove unreachable code\n\n- `drop_debugger` -- remove `debugger;` statements\n\n- `unsafe` (default: false) -- apply \"unsafe\" transformations (discussion below)\n\n- `conditionals` -- apply optimizations for `if`-s and conditional\n  expressions\n\n- `comparisons` -- apply certain optimizations to binary nodes, for example:\n  `!(a <= b) → a > b` (only when `unsafe`), attempts to negate binary nodes,\n  e.g. `a = !b && !c && !d && !e → a=!(b||c||d||e)` etc.\n\n- `evaluate` -- attempt to evaluate constant expressions\n\n- `booleans` -- various optimizations for boolean context, for example `!!a\n  ? b : c → a ? b : c`\n\n- `loops` -- optimizations for `do`, `while` and `for` loops when we can\n  statically determine the condition\n\n- `unused` -- drop unreferenced functions and variables\n\n- `hoist_funs` -- hoist function declarations\n\n- `hoist_vars` (default: false) -- hoist `var` declarations (this is `false`\n  by default because it seems to increase the size of the output in general)\n\n- `if_return` -- optimizations for if/return and if/continue\n\n- `join_vars` -- join consecutive `var` statements\n\n- `cascade` -- small optimization for sequences, transform `x, x` into `x`\n  and `x = something(), x` into `x = something()`\n\n- `warnings` -- display warnings when dropping unreachable code or unused\n  declarations etc.\n\n- `negate_iife` -- negate \"Immediately-Called Function Expressions\"\n  where the return value is discarded, to avoid the parens that the\n  code generator would insert.\n\n- `pure_getters` -- the default is `false`.  If you pass `true` for\n  this, UglifyJS will assume that object property access\n  (e.g. `foo.bar` or `foo[\"bar\"]`) doesn't have any side effects.\n\n- `pure_funcs` -- default `null`.  You can pass an array of names and\n  UglifyJS will assume that those functions do not produce side\n  effects.  DANGER: will not check if the name is redefined in scope.\n  An example case here, for instance `var q = Math.floor(a/b)`.  If\n  variable `q` is not used elsewhere, UglifyJS will drop it, but will\n  still keep the `Math.floor(a/b)`, not knowing what it does.  You can\n  pass `pure_funcs: [ 'Math.floor' ]` to let it know that this\n  function won't produce any side effect, in which case the whole\n  statement would get discarded.  The current implementation adds some\n  overhead (compression will be slower).\n\n### The `unsafe` option\n\nIt enables some transformations that *might* break code logic in certain\ncontrived cases, but should be fine for most code.  You might want to try it\non your own code, it should reduce the minified size.  Here's what happens\nwhen this flag is on:\n\n- `new Array(1, 2, 3)` or `Array(1, 2, 3)` → `[1, 2, 3 ]`\n- `new Object()` → `{}`\n- `String(exp)` or `exp.toString()` → `\"\" + exp`\n- `new Object/RegExp/Function/Error/Array (...)` → we discard the `new`\n- `typeof foo == \"undefined\"` → `foo === void 0`\n- `void 0` → `undefined` (if there is a variable named \"undefined\" in\n  scope; we do it because the variable name will be mangled, typically\n  reduced to a single character).\n\n### Conditional compilation\n\nYou can use the `--define` (`-d`) switch in order to declare global\nvariables that UglifyJS will assume to be constants (unless defined in\nscope).  For example if you pass `--define DEBUG=false` then, coupled with\ndead code removal UglifyJS will discard the following from the output:\n```javascript\nif (DEBUG) {\n\tconsole.log(\"debug stuff\");\n}\n```\n\nUglifyJS will warn about the condition being always false and about dropping\nunreachable code; for now there is no option to turn off only this specific\nwarning, you can pass `warnings=false` to turn off *all* warnings.\n\nAnother way of doing that is to declare your globals as constants in a\nseparate file and include it into the build.  For example you can have a\n`build/defines.js` file with the following:\n```javascript\nconst DEBUG = false;\nconst PRODUCTION = true;\n// etc.\n```\n\nand build your code like this:\n\n    uglifyjs build/defines.js js/foo.js js/bar.js... -c\n\nUglifyJS will notice the constants and, since they cannot be altered, it\nwill evaluate references to them to the value itself and drop unreachable\ncode as usual.  The possible downside of this approach is that the build\nwill contain the `const` declarations.\n\n<a name=\"codegen-options\"></a>\n## Beautifier options\n\nThe code generator tries to output shortest code possible by default.  In\ncase you want beautified output, pass `--beautify` (`-b`).  Optionally you\ncan pass additional arguments that control the code output:\n\n- `beautify` (default `true`) -- whether to actually beautify the output.\n  Passing `-b` will set this to true, but you might need to pass `-b` even\n  when you want to generate minified code, in order to specify additional\n  arguments, so you can use `-b beautify=false` to override it.\n- `indent-level` (default 4)\n- `indent-start` (default 0) -- prefix all lines by that many spaces\n- `quote-keys` (default `false`) -- pass `true` to quote all keys in literal\n  objects\n- `space-colon` (default `true`) -- insert a space after the colon signs\n- `ascii-only` (default `false`) -- escape Unicode characters in strings and\n  regexps\n- `inline-script` (default `false`) -- escape the slash in occurrences of\n  `</script` in strings\n- `width` (default 80) -- only takes effect when beautification is on, this\n  specifies an (orientative) line width that the beautifier will try to\n  obey.  It refers to the width of the line text (excluding indentation).\n  It doesn't work very well currently, but it does make the code generated\n  by UglifyJS more readable.\n- `max-line-len` (default 32000) -- maximum line length (for uglified code)\n- `bracketize` (default `false`) -- always insert brackets in `if`, `for`,\n  `do`, `while` or `with` statements, even if their body is a single\n  statement.\n- `semicolons` (default `true`) -- separate statements with semicolons.  If\n  you pass `false` then whenever possible we will use a newline instead of a\n  semicolon, leading to more readable output of uglified code (size before\n  gzip could be smaller; size after gzip insignificantly larger).\n- `preamble` (default `null`) -- when passed it must be a string and\n  it will be prepended to the output literally.  The source map will\n  adjust for this text.  Can be used to insert a comment containing\n  licensing information, for example.\n\n### Keeping copyright notices or other comments\n\nYou can pass `--comments` to retain certain comments in the output.  By\ndefault it will keep JSDoc-style comments that contain \"@preserve\",\n\"@license\" or \"@cc_on\" (conditional compilation for IE).  You can pass\n`--comments all` to keep all the comments, or a valid JavaScript regexp to\nkeep only comments that match this regexp.  For example `--comments\n'/foo|bar/'` will keep only comments that contain \"foo\" or \"bar\".\n\nNote, however, that there might be situations where comments are lost.  For\nexample:\n```javascript\nfunction f() {\n\t/** @preserve Foo Bar */\n\tfunction g() {\n\t  // this function is never called\n\t}\n\treturn something();\n}\n```\n\nEven though it has \"@preserve\", the comment will be lost because the inner\nfunction `g` (which is the AST node to which the comment is attached to) is\ndiscarded by the compressor as not referenced.\n\nThe safest comments where to place copyright information (or other info that\nneeds to be kept in the output) are comments attached to toplevel nodes.\n\n## Support for the SpiderMonkey AST\n\nUglifyJS2 has its own abstract syntax tree format; for\n[practical reasons](http://lisperator.net/blog/uglifyjs-why-not-switching-to-spidermonkey-ast/)\nwe can't easily change to using the SpiderMonkey AST internally.  However,\nUglifyJS now has a converter which can import a SpiderMonkey AST.\n\nFor example [Acorn][acorn] is a super-fast parser that produces a\nSpiderMonkey AST.  It has a small CLI utility that parses one file and dumps\nthe AST in JSON on the standard output.  To use UglifyJS to mangle and\ncompress that:\n\n    acorn file.js | uglifyjs --spidermonkey -m -c\n\nThe `--spidermonkey` option tells UglifyJS that all input files are not\nJavaScript, but JS code described in SpiderMonkey AST in JSON.  Therefore we\ndon't use our own parser in this case, but just transform that AST into our\ninternal AST.\n\n### Use Acorn for parsing\n\nMore for fun, I added the `--acorn` option which will use Acorn to do all\nthe parsing.  If you pass this option, UglifyJS will `require(\"acorn\")`.\n\nAcorn is really fast (e.g. 250ms instead of 380ms on some 650K code), but\nconverting the SpiderMonkey tree that Acorn produces takes another 150ms so\nin total it's a bit more than just using UglifyJS's own parser.\n\nAPI Reference\n-------------\n\nAssuming installation via NPM, you can load UglifyJS in your application\nlike this:\n```javascript\nvar UglifyJS = require(\"uglify-js\");\n```\n\nIt exports a lot of names, but I'll discuss here the basics that are needed\nfor parsing, mangling and compressing a piece of code.  The sequence is (1)\nparse, (2) compress, (3) mangle, (4) generate output code.\n\n### The simple way\n\nThere's a single toplevel function which combines all the steps.  If you\ndon't need additional customization, you might want to go with `minify`.\nExample:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify(\"/path/to/file.js\");\nconsole.log(result.code); // minified output\n// if you need to pass code instead of file name\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify(\"var b = function () {};\", {fromString: true});\n```\n\nYou can also compress multiple files:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ]);\nconsole.log(result.code);\n```\n\nTo generate a source map:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ], {\n\toutSourceMap: \"out.js.map\"\n});\nconsole.log(result.code); // minified output\nconsole.log(result.map);\n```\n\nNote that the source map is not saved in a file, it's just returned in\n`result.map`.  The value passed for `outSourceMap` is only used to set the\n`file` attribute in the source map (see [the spec][sm-spec]).\n\nYou can also specify sourceRoot property to be included in source map:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ], {\n\toutSourceMap: \"out.js.map\",\n\tsourceRoot: \"http://example.com/src\"\n});\n```\n\nIf you're compressing compiled JavaScript and have a source map for it, you\ncan use the `inSourceMap` argument:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify(\"compiled.js\", {\n\tinSourceMap: \"compiled.js.map\",\n\toutSourceMap: \"minified.js.map\"\n});\n// same as before, it returns `code` and `map`\n```\n\nThe `inSourceMap` is only used if you also request `outSourceMap` (it makes\nno sense otherwise).\n\nOther options:\n\n- `warnings` (default `false`) — pass `true` to display compressor warnings.\n\n- `fromString` (default `false`) — if you pass `true` then you can pass\n  JavaScript source code, rather than file names.\n\n- `mangle` — pass `false` to skip mangling names.\n\n- `output` (default `null`) — pass an object if you wish to specify\n  additional [output options][codegen].  The defaults are optimized\n  for best compression.\n\n- `compress` (default `{}`) — pass `false` to skip compressing entirely.\n  Pass an object to specify custom [compressor options][compressor].\n\nWe could add more options to `UglifyJS.minify` — if you need additional\nfunctionality please suggest!\n\n### The hard way\n\nFollowing there's more detailed API info, in case the `minify` function is\ntoo simple for your needs.\n\n#### The parser\n```javascript\nvar toplevel_ast = UglifyJS.parse(code, options);\n```\n\n`options` is optional and if present it must be an object.  The following\nproperties are available:\n\n- `strict` — disable automatic semicolon insertion and support for trailing\n  comma in arrays and objects\n- `filename` — the name of the file where this code is coming from\n- `toplevel` — a `toplevel` node (as returned by a previous invocation of\n  `parse`)\n\nThe last two options are useful when you'd like to minify multiple files and\nget a single file as the output and a proper source map.  Our CLI tool does\nsomething like this:\n```javascript\nvar toplevel = null;\nfiles.forEach(function(file){\n\tvar code = fs.readFileSync(file);\n\ttoplevel = UglifyJS.parse(code, {\n\t\tfilename: file,\n\t\ttoplevel: toplevel\n\t});\n});\n```\n\nAfter this, we have in `toplevel` a big AST containing all our files, with\neach token having proper information about where it came from.\n\n#### Scope information\n\nUglifyJS contains a scope analyzer that you need to call manually before\ncompressing or mangling.  Basically it augments various nodes in the AST\nwith information about where is a name defined, how many times is a name\nreferenced, if it is a global or not, if a function is using `eval` or the\n`with` statement etc.  I will discuss this some place else, for now what's\nimportant to know is that you need to call the following before doing\nanything with the tree:\n```javascript\ntoplevel.figure_out_scope()\n```\n\n#### Compression\n\nLike this:\n```javascript\nvar compressor = UglifyJS.Compressor(options);\nvar compressed_ast = toplevel.transform(compressor);\n```\n\nThe `options` can be missing.  Available options are discussed above in\n“Compressor options”.  Defaults should lead to best compression in most\nscripts.\n\nThe compressor is destructive, so don't rely that `toplevel` remains the\noriginal tree.\n\n#### Mangling\n\nAfter compression it is a good idea to call again `figure_out_scope` (since\nthe compressor might drop unused variables / unreachable code and this might\nchange the number of identifiers or their position).  Optionally, you can\ncall a trick that helps after Gzip (counting character frequency in\nnon-mangleable words).  Example:\n```javascript\ncompressed_ast.figure_out_scope();\ncompressed_ast.compute_char_frequency();\ncompressed_ast.mangle_names();\n```\n\n#### Generating output\n\nAST nodes have a `print` method that takes an output stream.  Essentially,\nto generate code you do this:\n```javascript\nvar stream = UglifyJS.OutputStream(options);\ncompressed_ast.print(stream);\nvar code = stream.toString(); // this is your minified code\n```\n\nor, for a shortcut you can do:\n```javascript\nvar code = compressed_ast.print_to_string(options);\n```\n\nAs usual, `options` is optional.  The output stream accepts a lot of otions,\nmost of them documented above in section “Beautifier options”.  The two\nwhich we care about here are `source_map` and `comments`.\n\n#### Keeping comments in the output\n\nIn order to keep certain comments in the output you need to pass the\n`comments` option.  Pass a RegExp or a function.  If you pass a RegExp, only\nthose comments whose body matches the regexp will be kept.  Note that body\nmeans without the initial `//` or `/*`.  If you pass a function, it will be\ncalled for every comment in the tree and will receive two arguments: the\nnode that the comment is attached to, and the comment token itself.\n\nThe comment token has these properties:\n\n- `type`: \"comment1\" for single-line comments or \"comment2\" for multi-line\n  comments\n- `value`: the comment body\n- `pos` and `endpos`: the start/end positions (zero-based indexes) in the\n  original code where this comment appears\n- `line` and `col`: the line and column where this comment appears in the\n  original code\n- `file` — the file name of the original file\n- `nlb` — true if there was a newline before this comment in the original\n  code, or if this comment contains a newline.\n\nYour function should return `true` to keep the comment, or a falsy value\notherwise.\n\n#### Generating a source mapping\n\nYou need to pass the `source_map` argument when calling `print`.  It needs\nto be a `SourceMap` object (which is a thin wrapper on top of the\n[source-map][source-map] library).\n\nExample:\n```javascript\nvar source_map = UglifyJS.SourceMap(source_map_options);\nvar stream = UglifyJS.OutputStream({\n\t...\n\tsource_map: source_map\n});\ncompressed_ast.print(stream);\n\nvar code = stream.toString();\nvar map = source_map.toString(); // json output for your source map\n```\n\nThe `source_map_options` (optional) can contain the following properties:\n\n- `file`: the name of the JavaScript output file that this mapping refers to\n- `root`: the `sourceRoot` property (see the [spec][sm-spec])\n- `orig`: the \"original source map\", handy when you compress generated JS\n  and want to map the minified output back to the original code where it\n  came from.  It can be simply a string in JSON, or a JSON object containing\n  the original source map.\n\n  [acorn]: https://github.com/marijnh/acorn\n  [source-map]: https://github.com/mozilla/source-map\n  [sm-spec]: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1RGAehQwRypUTovF1KRlpiOFze0b-_2gc6fAH0KY0k/edit\n  [codegen]: http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/codegen\n  [compressor]: http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/compress\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2/issues"},"_id":"uglify-js@2.4.4","dist":{"shasum":"f629e1e46bbe0bf4cf7232c7919e66b25a8fc529","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/uglify-js/-/uglify-js-2.4.4.tgz"},"_from":".","_npmVersion":"1.2.21","_npmUser":{"name":"mishoo","email":"mihai.bazon@gmail.com"},"directories":{}},"2.4.5":{"name":"uglify-js","description":"JavaScript parser, mangler/compressor and beautifier toolkit","homepage":"http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs","main":"tools/node.js","version":"2.4.5","engines":{"node":">=0.4.0"},"maintainers":[{"name":"caires","email":"cairesvs@gmail.com"},{"name":"mape","email":"mape@mape.me"},{"name":"mishoo","email":"mihai.bazon@gmail.com"}],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2.git"},"dependencies":{"async":"~0.2.6","source-map":"~0.1.7","optimist":"~0.3.5","uglify-to-browserify":"~1.0.0"},"browserify":{"transform":["uglify-to-browserify"]},"bin":{"uglifyjs":"bin/uglifyjs"},"scripts":{"test":"node test/run-tests.js"},"readme":"UglifyJS 2\n==========\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mishoo/UglifyJS2.png)](https://travis-ci.org/mishoo/UglifyJS2)\n\nUglifyJS is a JavaScript parser, minifier, compressor or beautifier toolkit.\n\nThis page documents the command line utility.  For\n[API and internals documentation see my website](http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/).\nThere's also an\n[in-browser online demo](http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/#demo) (for Firefox,\nChrome and probably Safari).\n\nInstall\n-------\n\nFirst make sure you have installed the latest version of [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)\n(You may need to restart your computer after this step).\n\nFrom NPM for use as a command line app:\n\n    npm install uglify-js -g\n\nFrom NPM for programmatic use:\n\n    npm install uglify-js\n\nFrom Git:\n\n    git clone git://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2.git\n    cd UglifyJS2\n    npm link .\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n    uglifyjs [input files] [options]\n\nUglifyJS2 can take multiple input files.  It's recommended that you pass the\ninput files first, then pass the options.  UglifyJS will parse input files\nin sequence and apply any compression options.  The files are parsed in the\nsame global scope, that is, a reference from a file to some\nvariable/function declared in another file will be matched properly.\n\nIf you want to read from STDIN instead, pass a single dash instead of input\nfiles.\n\nThe available options are:\n\n```\n  --source-map       Specify an output file where to generate source map.\n                                                                        [string]\n  --source-map-root  The path to the original source to be included in the\n                     source map.                                        [string]\n  --source-map-url   The path to the source map to be added in //#\n                     sourceMappingURL.  Defaults to the value passed with\n                     --source-map.                                      [string]\n  --in-source-map    Input source map, useful if you're compressing JS that was\n                     generated from some other original code.\n  --screw-ie8        Pass this flag if you don't care about full compliance\n                     with Internet Explorer 6-8 quirks (by default UglifyJS\n                     will try to be IE-proof).                         [boolean]\n  --expr             Parse a single expression, rather than a program (for\n                     parsing JSON)                                     [boolean]\n  -p, --prefix       Skip prefix for original filenames that appear in source\n                     maps. For example -p 3 will drop 3 directories from file\n                     names and ensure they are relative paths. You can also\n                     specify -p relative, which will make UglifyJS figure out\n                     itself the relative paths between original sources, the\n                     source map and the output file.                    [string]\n  -o, --output       Output file (default STDOUT).\n  -b, --beautify     Beautify output/specify output options.            [string]\n  -m, --mangle       Mangle names/pass mangler options.                 [string]\n  -r, --reserved     Reserved names to exclude from mangling.\n  -c, --compress     Enable compressor/pass compressor options. Pass options\n                     like -c hoist_vars=false,if_return=false. Use -c with no\n                     argument to use the default compression options.   [string]\n  -d, --define       Global definitions                                 [string]\n  -e, --enclose      Embed everything in a big function, with a configurable\n                     parameter/argument list.                           [string]\n  --comments         Preserve copyright comments in the output. By default this\n                     works like Google Closure, keeping JSDoc-style comments\n                     that contain \"@license\" or \"@preserve\". You can optionally\n                     pass one of the following arguments to this flag:\n                     - \"all\" to keep all comments\n                     - a valid JS regexp (needs to start with a slash) to keep\n                     only comments that match.\n                     Note that currently not *all* comments can be kept when\n                     compression is on, because of dead code removal or\n                     cascading statements into sequences.               [string]\n  --preamble         Preamble to prepend to the output.  You can use this to\n                     insert a comment, for example for licensing information.\n                     This will not be parsed, but the source map will adjust\n                     for its presence.\n  --stats            Display operations run time on STDERR.            [boolean]\n  --acorn            Use Acorn for parsing.                            [boolean]\n  --spidermonkey     Assume input files are SpiderMonkey AST format (as JSON).\n                                                                       [boolean]\n  --self             Build itself (UglifyJS2) as a library (implies\n                     --wrap=UglifyJS --export-all)                     [boolean]\n  --wrap             Embed everything in a big function, making the “exports”\n                     and “global” variables available. You need to pass an\n                     argument to this option to specify the name that your\n                     module will take when included in, say, a browser.\n                                                                        [string]\n  --export-all       Only used when --wrap, this tells UglifyJS to add code to\n                     automatically export all globals.                 [boolean]\n  --lint             Display some scope warnings                       [boolean]\n  -v, --verbose      Verbose                                           [boolean]\n  -V, --version      Print version number and exit.                    [boolean]\n```\n\nSpecify `--output` (`-o`) to declare the output file.  Otherwise the output\ngoes to STDOUT.\n\n## Source map options\n\nUglifyJS2 can generate a source map file, which is highly useful for\ndebugging your compressed JavaScript.  To get a source map, pass\n`--source-map output.js.map` (full path to the file where you want the\nsource map dumped).\n\nAdditionally you might need `--source-map-root` to pass the URL where the\noriginal files can be found.  In case you are passing full paths to input\nfiles to UglifyJS, you can use `--prefix` (`-p`) to specify the number of\ndirectories to drop from the path prefix when declaring files in the source\nmap.\n\nFor example:\n\n    uglifyjs /home/doe/work/foo/src/js/file1.js \\\n             /home/doe/work/foo/src/js/file2.js \\\n             -o foo.min.js \\\n             --source-map foo.min.js.map \\\n             --source-map-root http://foo.com/src \\\n             -p 5 -c -m\n\nThe above will compress and mangle `file1.js` and `file2.js`, will drop the\noutput in `foo.min.js` and the source map in `foo.min.js.map`.  The source\nmapping will refer to `http://foo.com/src/js/file1.js` and\n`http://foo.com/src/js/file2.js` (in fact it will list `http://foo.com/src`\nas the source map root, and the original files as `js/file1.js` and\n`js/file2.js`).\n\n### Composed source map\n\nWhen you're compressing JS code that was output by a compiler such as\nCoffeeScript, mapping to the JS code won't be too helpful.  Instead, you'd\nlike to map back to the original code (i.e. CoffeeScript).  UglifyJS has an\noption to take an input source map.  Assuming you have a mapping from\nCoffeeScript → compiled JS, UglifyJS can generate a map from CoffeeScript →\ncompressed JS by mapping every token in the compiled JS to its original\nlocation.\n\nTo use this feature you need to pass `--in-source-map\n/path/to/input/source.map`.  Normally the input source map should also point\nto the file containing the generated JS, so if that's correct you can omit\ninput files from the command line.\n\n## Mangler options\n\nTo enable the mangler you need to pass `--mangle` (`-m`).  The following\n(comma-separated) options are supported:\n\n- `sort` — to assign shorter names to most frequently used variables.  This\n  saves a few hundred bytes on jQuery before gzip, but the output is\n  _bigger_ after gzip (and seems to happen for other libraries I tried it\n  on) therefore it's not enabled by default.\n\n- `toplevel` — mangle names declared in the toplevel scope (disabled by\n  default).\n\n- `eval` — mangle names visible in scopes where `eval` or `when` are used\n  (disabled by default).\n\nWhen mangling is enabled but you want to prevent certain names from being\nmangled, you can declare those names with `--reserved` (`-r`) — pass a\ncomma-separated list of names.  For example:\n\n    uglifyjs ... -m -r '$,require,exports'\n\nto prevent the `require`, `exports` and `$` names from being changed.\n\n## Compressor options\n\nYou need to pass `--compress` (`-c`) to enable the compressor.  Optionally\nyou can pass a comma-separated list of options.  Options are in the form\n`foo=bar`, or just `foo` (the latter implies a boolean option that you want\nto set `true`; it's effectively a shortcut for `foo=true`).\n\n- `sequences` -- join consecutive simple statements using the comma operator\n\n- `properties` -- rewrite property access using the dot notation, for\n  example `foo[\"bar\"] → foo.bar`\n\n- `dead_code` -- remove unreachable code\n\n- `drop_debugger` -- remove `debugger;` statements\n\n- `unsafe` (default: false) -- apply \"unsafe\" transformations (discussion below)\n\n- `conditionals` -- apply optimizations for `if`-s and conditional\n  expressions\n\n- `comparisons` -- apply certain optimizations to binary nodes, for example:\n  `!(a <= b) → a > b` (only when `unsafe`), attempts to negate binary nodes,\n  e.g. `a = !b && !c && !d && !e → a=!(b||c||d||e)` etc.\n\n- `evaluate` -- attempt to evaluate constant expressions\n\n- `booleans` -- various optimizations for boolean context, for example `!!a\n  ? b : c → a ? b : c`\n\n- `loops` -- optimizations for `do`, `while` and `for` loops when we can\n  statically determine the condition\n\n- `unused` -- drop unreferenced functions and variables\n\n- `hoist_funs` -- hoist function declarations\n\n- `hoist_vars` (default: false) -- hoist `var` declarations (this is `false`\n  by default because it seems to increase the size of the output in general)\n\n- `if_return` -- optimizations for if/return and if/continue\n\n- `join_vars` -- join consecutive `var` statements\n\n- `cascade` -- small optimization for sequences, transform `x, x` into `x`\n  and `x = something(), x` into `x = something()`\n\n- `warnings` -- display warnings when dropping unreachable code or unused\n  declarations etc.\n\n- `negate_iife` -- negate \"Immediately-Called Function Expressions\"\n  where the return value is discarded, to avoid the parens that the\n  code generator would insert.\n\n- `pure_getters` -- the default is `false`.  If you pass `true` for\n  this, UglifyJS will assume that object property access\n  (e.g. `foo.bar` or `foo[\"bar\"]`) doesn't have any side effects.\n\n- `pure_funcs` -- default `null`.  You can pass an array of names and\n  UglifyJS will assume that those functions do not produce side\n  effects.  DANGER: will not check if the name is redefined in scope.\n  An example case here, for instance `var q = Math.floor(a/b)`.  If\n  variable `q` is not used elsewhere, UglifyJS will drop it, but will\n  still keep the `Math.floor(a/b)`, not knowing what it does.  You can\n  pass `pure_funcs: [ 'Math.floor' ]` to let it know that this\n  function won't produce any side effect, in which case the whole\n  statement would get discarded.  The current implementation adds some\n  overhead (compression will be slower).\n\n### The `unsafe` option\n\nIt enables some transformations that *might* break code logic in certain\ncontrived cases, but should be fine for most code.  You might want to try it\non your own code, it should reduce the minified size.  Here's what happens\nwhen this flag is on:\n\n- `new Array(1, 2, 3)` or `Array(1, 2, 3)` → `[1, 2, 3 ]`\n- `new Object()` → `{}`\n- `String(exp)` or `exp.toString()` → `\"\" + exp`\n- `new Object/RegExp/Function/Error/Array (...)` → we discard the `new`\n- `typeof foo == \"undefined\"` → `foo === void 0`\n- `void 0` → `undefined` (if there is a variable named \"undefined\" in\n  scope; we do it because the variable name will be mangled, typically\n  reduced to a single character).\n\n### Conditional compilation\n\nYou can use the `--define` (`-d`) switch in order to declare global\nvariables that UglifyJS will assume to be constants (unless defined in\nscope).  For example if you pass `--define DEBUG=false` then, coupled with\ndead code removal UglifyJS will discard the following from the output:\n```javascript\nif (DEBUG) {\n\tconsole.log(\"debug stuff\");\n}\n```\n\nUglifyJS will warn about the condition being always false and about dropping\nunreachable code; for now there is no option to turn off only this specific\nwarning, you can pass `warnings=false` to turn off *all* warnings.\n\nAnother way of doing that is to declare your globals as constants in a\nseparate file and include it into the build.  For example you can have a\n`build/defines.js` file with the following:\n```javascript\nconst DEBUG = false;\nconst PRODUCTION = true;\n// etc.\n```\n\nand build your code like this:\n\n    uglifyjs build/defines.js js/foo.js js/bar.js... -c\n\nUglifyJS will notice the constants and, since they cannot be altered, it\nwill evaluate references to them to the value itself and drop unreachable\ncode as usual.  The possible downside of this approach is that the build\nwill contain the `const` declarations.\n\n<a name=\"codegen-options\"></a>\n## Beautifier options\n\nThe code generator tries to output shortest code possible by default.  In\ncase you want beautified output, pass `--beautify` (`-b`).  Optionally you\ncan pass additional arguments that control the code output:\n\n- `beautify` (default `true`) -- whether to actually beautify the output.\n  Passing `-b` will set this to true, but you might need to pass `-b` even\n  when you want to generate minified code, in order to specify additional\n  arguments, so you can use `-b beautify=false` to override it.\n- `indent-level` (default 4)\n- `indent-start` (default 0) -- prefix all lines by that many spaces\n- `quote-keys` (default `false`) -- pass `true` to quote all keys in literal\n  objects\n- `space-colon` (default `true`) -- insert a space after the colon signs\n- `ascii-only` (default `false`) -- escape Unicode characters in strings and\n  regexps\n- `inline-script` (default `false`) -- escape the slash in occurrences of\n  `</script` in strings\n- `width` (default 80) -- only takes effect when beautification is on, this\n  specifies an (orientative) line width that the beautifier will try to\n  obey.  It refers to the width of the line text (excluding indentation).\n  It doesn't work very well currently, but it does make the code generated\n  by UglifyJS more readable.\n- `max-line-len` (default 32000) -- maximum line length (for uglified code)\n- `bracketize` (default `false`) -- always insert brackets in `if`, `for`,\n  `do`, `while` or `with` statements, even if their body is a single\n  statement.\n- `semicolons` (default `true`) -- separate statements with semicolons.  If\n  you pass `false` then whenever possible we will use a newline instead of a\n  semicolon, leading to more readable output of uglified code (size before\n  gzip could be smaller; size after gzip insignificantly larger).\n- `preamble` (default `null`) -- when passed it must be a string and\n  it will be prepended to the output literally.  The source map will\n  adjust for this text.  Can be used to insert a comment containing\n  licensing information, for example.\n\n### Keeping copyright notices or other comments\n\nYou can pass `--comments` to retain certain comments in the output.  By\ndefault it will keep JSDoc-style comments that contain \"@preserve\",\n\"@license\" or \"@cc_on\" (conditional compilation for IE).  You can pass\n`--comments all` to keep all the comments, or a valid JavaScript regexp to\nkeep only comments that match this regexp.  For example `--comments\n'/foo|bar/'` will keep only comments that contain \"foo\" or \"bar\".\n\nNote, however, that there might be situations where comments are lost.  For\nexample:\n```javascript\nfunction f() {\n\t/** @preserve Foo Bar */\n\tfunction g() {\n\t  // this function is never called\n\t}\n\treturn something();\n}\n```\n\nEven though it has \"@preserve\", the comment will be lost because the inner\nfunction `g` (which is the AST node to which the comment is attached to) is\ndiscarded by the compressor as not referenced.\n\nThe safest comments where to place copyright information (or other info that\nneeds to be kept in the output) are comments attached to toplevel nodes.\n\n## Support for the SpiderMonkey AST\n\nUglifyJS2 has its own abstract syntax tree format; for\n[practical reasons](http://lisperator.net/blog/uglifyjs-why-not-switching-to-spidermonkey-ast/)\nwe can't easily change to using the SpiderMonkey AST internally.  However,\nUglifyJS now has a converter which can import a SpiderMonkey AST.\n\nFor example [Acorn][acorn] is a super-fast parser that produces a\nSpiderMonkey AST.  It has a small CLI utility that parses one file and dumps\nthe AST in JSON on the standard output.  To use UglifyJS to mangle and\ncompress that:\n\n    acorn file.js | uglifyjs --spidermonkey -m -c\n\nThe `--spidermonkey` option tells UglifyJS that all input files are not\nJavaScript, but JS code described in SpiderMonkey AST in JSON.  Therefore we\ndon't use our own parser in this case, but just transform that AST into our\ninternal AST.\n\n### Use Acorn for parsing\n\nMore for fun, I added the `--acorn` option which will use Acorn to do all\nthe parsing.  If you pass this option, UglifyJS will `require(\"acorn\")`.\n\nAcorn is really fast (e.g. 250ms instead of 380ms on some 650K code), but\nconverting the SpiderMonkey tree that Acorn produces takes another 150ms so\nin total it's a bit more than just using UglifyJS's own parser.\n\nAPI Reference\n-------------\n\nAssuming installation via NPM, you can load UglifyJS in your application\nlike this:\n```javascript\nvar UglifyJS = require(\"uglify-js\");\n```\n\nIt exports a lot of names, but I'll discuss here the basics that are needed\nfor parsing, mangling and compressing a piece of code.  The sequence is (1)\nparse, (2) compress, (3) mangle, (4) generate output code.\n\n### The simple way\n\nThere's a single toplevel function which combines all the steps.  If you\ndon't need additional customization, you might want to go with `minify`.\nExample:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify(\"/path/to/file.js\");\nconsole.log(result.code); // minified output\n// if you need to pass code instead of file name\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify(\"var b = function () {};\", {fromString: true});\n```\n\nYou can also compress multiple files:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ]);\nconsole.log(result.code);\n```\n\nTo generate a source map:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ], {\n\toutSourceMap: \"out.js.map\"\n});\nconsole.log(result.code); // minified output\nconsole.log(result.map);\n```\n\nNote that the source map is not saved in a file, it's just returned in\n`result.map`.  The value passed for `outSourceMap` is only used to set the\n`file` attribute in the source map (see [the spec][sm-spec]).\n\nYou can also specify sourceRoot property to be included in source map:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ], {\n\toutSourceMap: \"out.js.map\",\n\tsourceRoot: \"http://example.com/src\"\n});\n```\n\nIf you're compressing compiled JavaScript and have a source map for it, you\ncan use the `inSourceMap` argument:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify(\"compiled.js\", {\n\tinSourceMap: \"compiled.js.map\",\n\toutSourceMap: \"minified.js.map\"\n});\n// same as before, it returns `code` and `map`\n```\n\nThe `inSourceMap` is only used if you also request `outSourceMap` (it makes\nno sense otherwise).\n\nOther options:\n\n- `warnings` (default `false`) — pass `true` to display compressor warnings.\n\n- `fromString` (default `false`) — if you pass `true` then you can pass\n  JavaScript source code, rather than file names.\n\n- `mangle` — pass `false` to skip mangling names.\n\n- `output` (default `null`) — pass an object if you wish to specify\n  additional [output options][codegen].  The defaults are optimized\n  for best compression.\n\n- `compress` (default `{}`) — pass `false` to skip compressing entirely.\n  Pass an object to specify custom [compressor options][compressor].\n\nWe could add more options to `UglifyJS.minify` — if you need additional\nfunctionality please suggest!\n\n### The hard way\n\nFollowing there's more detailed API info, in case the `minify` function is\ntoo simple for your needs.\n\n#### The parser\n```javascript\nvar toplevel_ast = UglifyJS.parse(code, options);\n```\n\n`options` is optional and if present it must be an object.  The following\nproperties are available:\n\n- `strict` — disable automatic semicolon insertion and support for trailing\n  comma in arrays and objects\n- `filename` — the name of the file where this code is coming from\n- `toplevel` — a `toplevel` node (as returned by a previous invocation of\n  `parse`)\n\nThe last two options are useful when you'd like to minify multiple files and\nget a single file as the output and a proper source map.  Our CLI tool does\nsomething like this:\n```javascript\nvar toplevel = null;\nfiles.forEach(function(file){\n\tvar code = fs.readFileSync(file);\n\ttoplevel = UglifyJS.parse(code, {\n\t\tfilename: file,\n\t\ttoplevel: toplevel\n\t});\n});\n```\n\nAfter this, we have in `toplevel` a big AST containing all our files, with\neach token having proper information about where it came from.\n\n#### Scope information\n\nUglifyJS contains a scope analyzer that you need to call manually before\ncompressing or mangling.  Basically it augments various nodes in the AST\nwith information about where is a name defined, how many times is a name\nreferenced, if it is a global or not, if a function is using `eval` or the\n`with` statement etc.  I will discuss this some place else, for now what's\nimportant to know is that you need to call the following before doing\nanything with the tree:\n```javascript\ntoplevel.figure_out_scope()\n```\n\n#### Compression\n\nLike this:\n```javascript\nvar compressor = UglifyJS.Compressor(options);\nvar compressed_ast = toplevel.transform(compressor);\n```\n\nThe `options` can be missing.  Available options are discussed above in\n“Compressor options”.  Defaults should lead to best compression in most\nscripts.\n\nThe compressor is destructive, so don't rely that `toplevel` remains the\noriginal tree.\n\n#### Mangling\n\nAfter compression it is a good idea to call again `figure_out_scope` (since\nthe compressor might drop unused variables / unreachable code and this might\nchange the number of identifiers or their position).  Optionally, you can\ncall a trick that helps after Gzip (counting character frequency in\nnon-mangleable words).  Example:\n```javascript\ncompressed_ast.figure_out_scope();\ncompressed_ast.compute_char_frequency();\ncompressed_ast.mangle_names();\n```\n\n#### Generating output\n\nAST nodes have a `print` method that takes an output stream.  Essentially,\nto generate code you do this:\n```javascript\nvar stream = UglifyJS.OutputStream(options);\ncompressed_ast.print(stream);\nvar code = stream.toString(); // this is your minified code\n```\n\nor, for a shortcut you can do:\n```javascript\nvar code = compressed_ast.print_to_string(options);\n```\n\nAs usual, `options` is optional.  The output stream accepts a lot of otions,\nmost of them documented above in section “Beautifier options”.  The two\nwhich we care about here are `source_map` and `comments`.\n\n#### Keeping comments in the output\n\nIn order to keep certain comments in the output you need to pass the\n`comments` option.  Pass a RegExp or a function.  If you pass a RegExp, only\nthose comments whose body matches the regexp will be kept.  Note that body\nmeans without the initial `//` or `/*`.  If you pass a function, it will be\ncalled for every comment in the tree and will receive two arguments: the\nnode that the comment is attached to, and the comment token itself.\n\nThe comment token has these properties:\n\n- `type`: \"comment1\" for single-line comments or \"comment2\" for multi-line\n  comments\n- `value`: the comment body\n- `pos` and `endpos`: the start/end positions (zero-based indexes) in the\n  original code where this comment appears\n- `line` and `col`: the line and column where this comment appears in the\n  original code\n- `file` — the file name of the original file\n- `nlb` — true if there was a newline before this comment in the original\n  code, or if this comment contains a newline.\n\nYour function should return `true` to keep the comment, or a falsy value\notherwise.\n\n#### Generating a source mapping\n\nYou need to pass the `source_map` argument when calling `print`.  It needs\nto be a `SourceMap` object (which is a thin wrapper on top of the\n[source-map][source-map] library).\n\nExample:\n```javascript\nvar source_map = UglifyJS.SourceMap(source_map_options);\nvar stream = UglifyJS.OutputStream({\n\t...\n\tsource_map: source_map\n});\ncompressed_ast.print(stream);\n\nvar code = stream.toString();\nvar map = source_map.toString(); // json output for your source map\n```\n\nThe `source_map_options` (optional) can contain the following properties:\n\n- `file`: the name of the JavaScript output file that this mapping refers to\n- `root`: the `sourceRoot` property (see the [spec][sm-spec])\n- `orig`: the \"original source map\", handy when you compress generated JS\n  and want to map the minified output back to the original code where it\n  came from.  It can be simply a string in JSON, or a JSON object containing\n  the original source map.\n\n  [acorn]: https://github.com/marijnh/acorn\n  [source-map]: https://github.com/mozilla/source-map\n  [sm-spec]: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1RGAehQwRypUTovF1KRlpiOFze0b-_2gc6fAH0KY0k/edit\n  [codegen]: http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/codegen\n  [compressor]: http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/compress\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2/issues"},"_id":"uglify-js@2.4.5","dist":{"shasum":"3bc46a71c14287cd94b6f111aec252fe50315c3a","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/uglify-js/-/uglify-js-2.4.5.tgz"},"_from":".","_npmVersion":"1.2.21","_npmUser":{"name":"mishoo","email":"mihai.bazon@gmail.com"},"directories":{}},"2.4.6":{"name":"uglify-js","description":"JavaScript parser, mangler/compressor and beautifier toolkit","homepage":"http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs","main":"tools/node.js","version":"2.4.6","engines":{"node":">=0.4.0"},"maintainers":[{"name":"caires","email":"cairesvs@gmail.com"},{"name":"mape","email":"mape@mape.me"},{"name":"mishoo","email":"mihai.bazon@gmail.com"}],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2.git"},"dependencies":{"async":"~0.2.6","source-map":"~0.1.7","optimist":"~0.3.5","uglify-to-browserify":"~1.0.0"},"browserify":{"transform":["uglify-to-browserify"]},"bin":{"uglifyjs":"bin/uglifyjs"},"scripts":{"test":"node test/run-tests.js"},"readme":"UglifyJS 2\n==========\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mishoo/UglifyJS2.png)](https://travis-ci.org/mishoo/UglifyJS2)\n\nUglifyJS is a JavaScript parser, minifier, compressor or beautifier toolkit.\n\nThis page documents the command line utility.  For\n[API and internals documentation see my website](http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/).\nThere's also an\n[in-browser online demo](http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/#demo) (for Firefox,\nChrome and probably Safari).\n\nInstall\n-------\n\nFirst make sure you have installed the latest version of [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)\n(You may need to restart your computer after this step).\n\nFrom NPM for use as a command line app:\n\n    npm install uglify-js -g\n\nFrom NPM for programmatic use:\n\n    npm install uglify-js\n\nFrom Git:\n\n    git clone git://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2.git\n    cd UglifyJS2\n    npm link .\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n    uglifyjs [input files] [options]\n\nUglifyJS2 can take multiple input files.  It's recommended that you pass the\ninput files first, then pass the options.  UglifyJS will parse input files\nin sequence and apply any compression options.  The files are parsed in the\nsame global scope, that is, a reference from a file to some\nvariable/function declared in another file will be matched properly.\n\nIf you want to read from STDIN instead, pass a single dash instead of input\nfiles.\n\nThe available options are:\n\n```\n  --source-map       Specify an output file where to generate source map.\n                                                                        [string]\n  --source-map-root  The path to the original source to be included in the\n                     source map.                                        [string]\n  --source-map-url   The path to the source map to be added in //#\n                     sourceMappingURL.  Defaults to the value passed with\n                     --source-map.                                      [string]\n  --in-source-map    Input source map, useful if you're compressing JS that was\n                     generated from some other original code.\n  --screw-ie8        Pass this flag if you don't care about full compliance\n                     with Internet Explorer 6-8 quirks (by default UglifyJS\n                     will try to be IE-proof).                         [boolean]\n  --expr             Parse a single expression, rather than a program (for\n                     parsing JSON)                                     [boolean]\n  -p, --prefix       Skip prefix for original filenames that appear in source\n                     maps. For example -p 3 will drop 3 directories from file\n                     names and ensure they are relative paths. You can also\n                     specify -p relative, which will make UglifyJS figure out\n                     itself the relative paths between original sources, the\n                     source map and the output file.                    [string]\n  -o, --output       Output file (default STDOUT).\n  -b, --beautify     Beautify output/specify output options.            [string]\n  -m, --mangle       Mangle names/pass mangler options.                 [string]\n  -r, --reserved     Reserved names to exclude from mangling.\n  -c, --compress     Enable compressor/pass compressor options. Pass options\n                     like -c hoist_vars=false,if_return=false. Use -c with no\n                     argument to use the default compression options.   [string]\n  -d, --define       Global definitions                                 [string]\n  -e, --enclose      Embed everything in a big function, with a configurable\n                     parameter/argument list.                           [string]\n  --comments         Preserve copyright comments in the output. By default this\n                     works like Google Closure, keeping JSDoc-style comments\n                     that contain \"@license\" or \"@preserve\". You can optionally\n                     pass one of the following arguments to this flag:\n                     - \"all\" to keep all comments\n                     - a valid JS regexp (needs to start with a slash) to keep\n                     only comments that match.\n                     Note that currently not *all* comments can be kept when\n                     compression is on, because of dead code removal or\n                     cascading statements into sequences.               [string]\n  --preamble         Preamble to prepend to the output.  You can use this to\n                     insert a comment, for example for licensing information.\n                     This will not be parsed, but the source map will adjust\n                     for its presence.\n  --stats            Display operations run time on STDERR.            [boolean]\n  --acorn            Use Acorn for parsing.                            [boolean]\n  --spidermonkey     Assume input files are SpiderMonkey AST format (as JSON).\n                                                                       [boolean]\n  --self             Build itself (UglifyJS2) as a library (implies\n                     --wrap=UglifyJS --export-all)                     [boolean]\n  --wrap             Embed everything in a big function, making the “exports”\n                     and “global” variables available. You need to pass an\n                     argument to this option to specify the name that your\n                     module will take when included in, say, a browser.\n                                                                        [string]\n  --export-all       Only used when --wrap, this tells UglifyJS to add code to\n                     automatically export all globals.                 [boolean]\n  --lint             Display some scope warnings                       [boolean]\n  -v, --verbose      Verbose                                           [boolean]\n  -V, --version      Print version number and exit.                    [boolean]\n```\n\nSpecify `--output` (`-o`) to declare the output file.  Otherwise the output\ngoes to STDOUT.\n\n## Source map options\n\nUglifyJS2 can generate a source map file, which is highly useful for\ndebugging your compressed JavaScript.  To get a source map, pass\n`--source-map output.js.map` (full path to the file where you want the\nsource map dumped).\n\nAdditionally you might need `--source-map-root` to pass the URL where the\noriginal files can be found.  In case you are passing full paths to input\nfiles to UglifyJS, you can use `--prefix` (`-p`) to specify the number of\ndirectories to drop from the path prefix when declaring files in the source\nmap.\n\nFor example:\n\n    uglifyjs /home/doe/work/foo/src/js/file1.js \\\n             /home/doe/work/foo/src/js/file2.js \\\n             -o foo.min.js \\\n             --source-map foo.min.js.map \\\n             --source-map-root http://foo.com/src \\\n             -p 5 -c -m\n\nThe above will compress and mangle `file1.js` and `file2.js`, will drop the\noutput in `foo.min.js` and the source map in `foo.min.js.map`.  The source\nmapping will refer to `http://foo.com/src/js/file1.js` and\n`http://foo.com/src/js/file2.js` (in fact it will list `http://foo.com/src`\nas the source map root, and the original files as `js/file1.js` and\n`js/file2.js`).\n\n### Composed source map\n\nWhen you're compressing JS code that was output by a compiler such as\nCoffeeScript, mapping to the JS code won't be too helpful.  Instead, you'd\nlike to map back to the original code (i.e. CoffeeScript).  UglifyJS has an\noption to take an input source map.  Assuming you have a mapping from\nCoffeeScript → compiled JS, UglifyJS can generate a map from CoffeeScript →\ncompressed JS by mapping every token in the compiled JS to its original\nlocation.\n\nTo use this feature you need to pass `--in-source-map\n/path/to/input/source.map`.  Normally the input source map should also point\nto the file containing the generated JS, so if that's correct you can omit\ninput files from the command line.\n\n## Mangler options\n\nTo enable the mangler you need to pass `--mangle` (`-m`).  The following\n(comma-separated) options are supported:\n\n- `sort` — to assign shorter names to most frequently used variables.  This\n  saves a few hundred bytes on jQuery before gzip, but the output is\n  _bigger_ after gzip (and seems to happen for other libraries I tried it\n  on) therefore it's not enabled by default.\n\n- `toplevel` — mangle names declared in the toplevel scope (disabled by\n  default).\n\n- `eval` — mangle names visible in scopes where `eval` or `when` are used\n  (disabled by default).\n\nWhen mangling is enabled but you want to prevent certain names from being\nmangled, you can declare those names with `--reserved` (`-r`) — pass a\ncomma-separated list of names.  For example:\n\n    uglifyjs ... -m -r '$,require,exports'\n\nto prevent the `require`, `exports` and `$` names from being changed.\n\n## Compressor options\n\nYou need to pass `--compress` (`-c`) to enable the compressor.  Optionally\nyou can pass a comma-separated list of options.  Options are in the form\n`foo=bar`, or just `foo` (the latter implies a boolean option that you want\nto set `true`; it's effectively a shortcut for `foo=true`).\n\n- `sequences` -- join consecutive simple statements using the comma operator\n\n- `properties` -- rewrite property access using the dot notation, for\n  example `foo[\"bar\"] → foo.bar`\n\n- `dead_code` -- remove unreachable code\n\n- `drop_debugger` -- remove `debugger;` statements\n\n- `unsafe` (default: false) -- apply \"unsafe\" transformations (discussion below)\n\n- `conditionals` -- apply optimizations for `if`-s and conditional\n  expressions\n\n- `comparisons` -- apply certain optimizations to binary nodes, for example:\n  `!(a <= b) → a > b` (only when `unsafe`), attempts to negate binary nodes,\n  e.g. `a = !b && !c && !d && !e → a=!(b||c||d||e)` etc.\n\n- `evaluate` -- attempt to evaluate constant expressions\n\n- `booleans` -- various optimizations for boolean context, for example `!!a\n  ? b : c → a ? b : c`\n\n- `loops` -- optimizations for `do`, `while` and `for` loops when we can\n  statically determine the condition\n\n- `unused` -- drop unreferenced functions and variables\n\n- `hoist_funs` -- hoist function declarations\n\n- `hoist_vars` (default: false) -- hoist `var` declarations (this is `false`\n  by default because it seems to increase the size of the output in general)\n\n- `if_return` -- optimizations for if/return and if/continue\n\n- `join_vars` -- join consecutive `var` statements\n\n- `cascade` -- small optimization for sequences, transform `x, x` into `x`\n  and `x = something(), x` into `x = something()`\n\n- `warnings` -- display warnings when dropping unreachable code or unused\n  declarations etc.\n\n- `negate_iife` -- negate \"Immediately-Called Function Expressions\"\n  where the return value is discarded, to avoid the parens that the\n  code generator would insert.\n\n- `pure_getters` -- the default is `false`.  If you pass `true` for\n  this, UglifyJS will assume that object property access\n  (e.g. `foo.bar` or `foo[\"bar\"]`) doesn't have any side effects.\n\n- `pure_funcs` -- default `null`.  You can pass an array of names and\n  UglifyJS will assume that those functions do not produce side\n  effects.  DANGER: will not check if the name is redefined in scope.\n  An example case here, for instance `var q = Math.floor(a/b)`.  If\n  variable `q` is not used elsewhere, UglifyJS will drop it, but will\n  still keep the `Math.floor(a/b)`, not knowing what it does.  You can\n  pass `pure_funcs: [ 'Math.floor' ]` to let it know that this\n  function won't produce any side effect, in which case the whole\n  statement would get discarded.  The current implementation adds some\n  overhead (compression will be slower).\n\n### The `unsafe` option\n\nIt enables some transformations that *might* break code logic in certain\ncontrived cases, but should be fine for most code.  You might want to try it\non your own code, it should reduce the minified size.  Here's what happens\nwhen this flag is on:\n\n- `new Array(1, 2, 3)` or `Array(1, 2, 3)` → `[1, 2, 3 ]`\n- `new Object()` → `{}`\n- `String(exp)` or `exp.toString()` → `\"\" + exp`\n- `new Object/RegExp/Function/Error/Array (...)` → we discard the `new`\n- `typeof foo == \"undefined\"` → `foo === void 0`\n- `void 0` → `undefined` (if there is a variable named \"undefined\" in\n  scope; we do it because the variable name will be mangled, typically\n  reduced to a single character).\n\n### Conditional compilation\n\nYou can use the `--define` (`-d`) switch in order to declare global\nvariables that UglifyJS will assume to be constants (unless defined in\nscope).  For example if you pass `--define DEBUG=false` then, coupled with\ndead code removal UglifyJS will discard the following from the output:\n```javascript\nif (DEBUG) {\n\tconsole.log(\"debug stuff\");\n}\n```\n\nUglifyJS will warn about the condition being always false and about dropping\nunreachable code; for now there is no option to turn off only this specific\nwarning, you can pass `warnings=false` to turn off *all* warnings.\n\nAnother way of doing that is to declare your globals as constants in a\nseparate file and include it into the build.  For example you can have a\n`build/defines.js` file with the following:\n```javascript\nconst DEBUG = false;\nconst PRODUCTION = true;\n// etc.\n```\n\nand build your code like this:\n\n    uglifyjs build/defines.js js/foo.js js/bar.js... -c\n\nUglifyJS will notice the constants and, since they cannot be altered, it\nwill evaluate references to them to the value itself and drop unreachable\ncode as usual.  The possible downside of this approach is that the build\nwill contain the `const` declarations.\n\n<a name=\"codegen-options\"></a>\n## Beautifier options\n\nThe code generator tries to output shortest code possible by default.  In\ncase you want beautified output, pass `--beautify` (`-b`).  Optionally you\ncan pass additional arguments that control the code output:\n\n- `beautify` (default `true`) -- whether to actually beautify the output.\n  Passing `-b` will set this to true, but you might need to pass `-b` even\n  when you want to generate minified code, in order to specify additional\n  arguments, so you can use `-b beautify=false` to override it.\n- `indent-level` (default 4)\n- `indent-start` (default 0) -- prefix all lines by that many spaces\n- `quote-keys` (default `false`) -- pass `true` to quote all keys in literal\n  objects\n- `space-colon` (default `true`) -- insert a space after the colon signs\n- `ascii-only` (default `false`) -- escape Unicode characters in strings and\n  regexps\n- `inline-script` (default `false`) -- escape the slash in occurrences of\n  `</script` in strings\n- `width` (default 80) -- only takes effect when beautification is on, this\n  specifies an (orientative) line width that the beautifier will try to\n  obey.  It refers to the width of the line text (excluding indentation).\n  It doesn't work very well currently, but it does make the code generated\n  by UglifyJS more readable.\n- `max-line-len` (default 32000) -- maximum line length (for uglified code)\n- `bracketize` (default `false`) -- always insert brackets in `if`, `for`,\n  `do`, `while` or `with` statements, even if their body is a single\n  statement.\n- `semicolons` (default `true`) -- separate statements with semicolons.  If\n  you pass `false` then whenever possible we will use a newline instead of a\n  semicolon, leading to more readable output of uglified code (size before\n  gzip could be smaller; size after gzip insignificantly larger).\n- `preamble` (default `null`) -- when passed it must be a string and\n  it will be prepended to the output literally.  The source map will\n  adjust for this text.  Can be used to insert a comment containing\n  licensing information, for example.\n\n### Keeping copyright notices or other comments\n\nYou can pass `--comments` to retain certain comments in the output.  By\ndefault it will keep JSDoc-style comments that contain \"@preserve\",\n\"@license\" or \"@cc_on\" (conditional compilation for IE).  You can pass\n`--comments all` to keep all the comments, or a valid JavaScript regexp to\nkeep only comments that match this regexp.  For example `--comments\n'/foo|bar/'` will keep only comments that contain \"foo\" or \"bar\".\n\nNote, however, that there might be situations where comments are lost.  For\nexample:\n```javascript\nfunction f() {\n\t/** @preserve Foo Bar */\n\tfunction g() {\n\t  // this function is never called\n\t}\n\treturn something();\n}\n```\n\nEven though it has \"@preserve\", the comment will be lost because the inner\nfunction `g` (which is the AST node to which the comment is attached to) is\ndiscarded by the compressor as not referenced.\n\nThe safest comments where to place copyright information (or other info that\nneeds to be kept in the output) are comments attached to toplevel nodes.\n\n## Support for the SpiderMonkey AST\n\nUglifyJS2 has its own abstract syntax tree format; for\n[practical reasons](http://lisperator.net/blog/uglifyjs-why-not-switching-to-spidermonkey-ast/)\nwe can't easily change to using the SpiderMonkey AST internally.  However,\nUglifyJS now has a converter which can import a SpiderMonkey AST.\n\nFor example [Acorn][acorn] is a super-fast parser that produces a\nSpiderMonkey AST.  It has a small CLI utility that parses one file and dumps\nthe AST in JSON on the standard output.  To use UglifyJS to mangle and\ncompress that:\n\n    acorn file.js | uglifyjs --spidermonkey -m -c\n\nThe `--spidermonkey` option tells UglifyJS that all input files are not\nJavaScript, but JS code described in SpiderMonkey AST in JSON.  Therefore we\ndon't use our own parser in this case, but just transform that AST into our\ninternal AST.\n\n### Use Acorn for parsing\n\nMore for fun, I added the `--acorn` option which will use Acorn to do all\nthe parsing.  If you pass this option, UglifyJS will `require(\"acorn\")`.\n\nAcorn is really fast (e.g. 250ms instead of 380ms on some 650K code), but\nconverting the SpiderMonkey tree that Acorn produces takes another 150ms so\nin total it's a bit more than just using UglifyJS's own parser.\n\nAPI Reference\n-------------\n\nAssuming installation via NPM, you can load UglifyJS in your application\nlike this:\n```javascript\nvar UglifyJS = require(\"uglify-js\");\n```\n\nIt exports a lot of names, but I'll discuss here the basics that are needed\nfor parsing, mangling and compressing a piece of code.  The sequence is (1)\nparse, (2) compress, (3) mangle, (4) generate output code.\n\n### The simple way\n\nThere's a single toplevel function which combines all the steps.  If you\ndon't need additional customization, you might want to go with `minify`.\nExample:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify(\"/path/to/file.js\");\nconsole.log(result.code); // minified output\n// if you need to pass code instead of file name\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify(\"var b = function () {};\", {fromString: true});\n```\n\nYou can also compress multiple files:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ]);\nconsole.log(result.code);\n```\n\nTo generate a source map:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ], {\n\toutSourceMap: \"out.js.map\"\n});\nconsole.log(result.code); // minified output\nconsole.log(result.map);\n```\n\nNote that the source map is not saved in a file, it's just returned in\n`result.map`.  The value passed for `outSourceMap` is only used to set the\n`file` attribute in the source map (see [the spec][sm-spec]).\n\nYou can also specify sourceRoot property to be included in source map:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify([ \"file1.js\", \"file2.js\", \"file3.js\" ], {\n\toutSourceMap: \"out.js.map\",\n\tsourceRoot: \"http://example.com/src\"\n});\n```\n\nIf you're compressing compiled JavaScript and have a source map for it, you\ncan use the `inSourceMap` argument:\n```javascript\nvar result = UglifyJS.minify(\"compiled.js\", {\n\tinSourceMap: \"compiled.js.map\",\n\toutSourceMap: \"minified.js.map\"\n});\n// same as before, it returns `code` and `map`\n```\n\nThe `inSourceMap` is only used if you also request `outSourceMap` (it makes\nno sense otherwise).\n\nOther options:\n\n- `warnings` (default `false`) — pass `true` to display compressor warnings.\n\n- `fromString` (default `false`) — if you pass `true` then you can pass\n  JavaScript source code, rather than file names.\n\n- `mangle` — pass `false` to skip mangling names.\n\n- `output` (default `null`) — pass an object if you wish to specify\n  additional [output options][codegen].  The defaults are optimized\n  for best compression.\n\n- `compress` (default `{}`) — pass `false` to skip compressing entirely.\n  Pass an object to specify custom [compressor options][compressor].\n\nWe could add more options to `UglifyJS.minify` — if you need additional\nfunctionality please suggest!\n\n### The hard way\n\nFollowing there's more detailed API info, in case the `minify` function is\ntoo simple for your needs.\n\n#### The parser\n```javascript\nvar toplevel_ast = UglifyJS.parse(code, options);\n```\n\n`options` is optional and if present it must be an object.  The following\nproperties are available:\n\n- `strict` — disable automatic semicolon insertion and support for trailing\n  comma in arrays and objects\n- `filename` — the name of the file where this code is coming from\n- `toplevel` — a `toplevel` node (as returned by a previous invocation of\n  `parse`)\n\nThe last two options are useful when you'd like to minify multiple files and\nget a single file as the output and a proper source map.  Our CLI tool does\nsomething like this:\n```javascript\nvar toplevel = null;\nfiles.forEach(function(file){\n\tvar code = fs.readFileSync(file);\n\ttoplevel = UglifyJS.parse(code, {\n\t\tfilename: file,\n\t\ttoplevel: toplevel\n\t});\n});\n```\n\nAfter this, we have in `toplevel` a big AST containing all our files, with\neach token having proper information about where it came from.\n\n#### Scope information\n\nUglifyJS contains a scope analyzer that you need to call manually before\ncompressing or mangling.  Basically it augments various nodes in the AST\nwith information about where is a name defined, how many times is a name\nreferenced, if it is a global or not, if a function is using `eval` or the\n`with` statement etc.  I will discuss this some place else, for now what's\nimportant to know is that you need to call the following before doing\nanything with the tree:\n```javascript\ntoplevel.figure_out_scope()\n```\n\n#### Compression\n\nLike this:\n```javascript\nvar compressor = UglifyJS.Compressor(options);\nvar compressed_ast = toplevel.transform(compressor);\n```\n\nThe `options` can be missing.  Available options are discussed above in\n“Compressor options”.  Defaults should lead to best compression in most\nscripts.\n\nThe compressor is destructive, so don't rely that `toplevel` remains the\noriginal tree.\n\n#### Mangling\n\nAfter compression it is a good idea to call again `figure_out_scope` (since\nthe compressor might drop unused variables / unreachable code and this might\nchange the number of identifiers or their position).  Optionally, you can\ncall a trick that helps after Gzip (counting character frequency in\nnon-mangleable words).  Example:\n```javascript\ncompressed_ast.figure_out_scope();\ncompressed_ast.compute_char_frequency();\ncompressed_ast.mangle_names();\n```\n\n#### Generating output\n\nAST nodes have a `print` method that takes an output stream.  Essentially,\nto generate code you do this:\n```javascript\nvar stream = UglifyJS.OutputStream(options);\ncompressed_ast.print(stream);\nvar code = stream.toString(); // this is your minified code\n```\n\nor, for a shortcut you can do:\n```javascript\nvar code = compressed_ast.print_to_string(options);\n```\n\nAs usual, `options` is optional.  The output stream accepts a lot of otions,\nmost of them documented above in section “Beautifier options”.  The two\nwhich we care about here are `source_map` and `comments`.\n\n#### Keeping comments in the output\n\nIn order to keep certain comments in the output you need to pass the\n`comments` option.  Pass a RegExp or a function.  If you pass a RegExp, only\nthose comments whose body matches the regexp will be kept.  Note that body\nmeans without the initial `//` or `/*`.  If you pass a function, it will be\ncalled for every comment in the tree and will receive two arguments: the\nnode that the comment is attached to, and the comment token itself.\n\nThe comment token has these properties:\n\n- `type`: \"comment1\" for single-line comments or \"comment2\" for multi-line\n  comments\n- `value`: the comment body\n- `pos` and `endpos`: the start/end positions (zero-based indexes) in the\n  original code where this comment appears\n- `line` and `col`: the line and column where this comment appears in the\n  original code\n- `file` — the file name of the original file\n- `nlb` — true if there was a newline before this comment in the original\n  code, or if this comment contains a newline.\n\nYour function should return `true` to keep the comment, or a falsy value\notherwise.\n\n#### Generating a source mapping\n\nYou need to pass the `source_map` argument when calling `print`.  It needs\nto be a `SourceMap` object (which is a thin wrapper on top of the\n[source-map][source-map] library).\n\nExample:\n```javascript\nvar source_map = UglifyJS.SourceMap(source_map_options);\nvar stream = UglifyJS.OutputStream({\n\t...\n\tsource_map: source_map\n});\ncompressed_ast.print(stream);\n\nvar code = stream.toString();\nvar map = source_map.toString(); // json output for your source map\n```\n\nThe `source_map_options` (optional) can contain the following properties:\n\n- `file`: the name of the JavaScript output file that this mapping refers to\n- `root`: the `sourceRoot` property (see the [spec][sm-spec])\n- `orig`: the \"original source map\", handy when you compress generated JS\n  and want to map the minified output back to the original code where it\n  came from.  It can be simply a string in JSON, or a JSON object containing\n  the original source map.\n\n  [acorn]: https://github.com/marijnh/acorn\n  [source-map]: https://github.com/mozilla/source-map\n
